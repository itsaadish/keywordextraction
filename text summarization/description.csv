It created quite a stir.Obviously, many people criticized his controversial opinion and made fun of him for saying so. Some, including former United States attorney Preet Bharara offered to take him to an Indian restaurant also. That happened quite recently.Indian food is terrible and we pretend it isnt. after his visit to the Indian restaurant Tom has become viral once again on Twitter. But this time it is for all the right reasons. The author tried a lot of Indian food including mutton, fried ricotta, spicy shrimp, lamb chops, butter chicken, and biryani.Turns out, he totally loved the biryani. (We're not even surprised). He talked to USA Today and described how he couldn't get over the lamb biryani he ate.Tom Nichols: I said I couldn't stand Indian food. Then a Twitter friend took me to dinner. via cc He told USA Today, ""A bowl of lamb biryani appeared in front of me. I looked at it  as I had at everything  with a bit of trepidation. But I dug in. Fragrant, with lamb I could cut with a fork. I was entranced. I had found an Indian dish, after years, that I loved. I polished it off.""We have a winner. The first thing I would order again and could even imagine having a craving for at some point. Lamb biryani.

And worth it to see that Covid relief for India is just a whisker away from 80K. Wow , Tom finally admitted that his opinion has changed after trying the lamb biryani and he's happy about it.I will admit that things may have changed.

Now to become a full convert , you should visit India & dare to try various street foods, not just gourmet Indian food & then share your experience with readers of . an Englishman, I always knew this moment was a long time coming and Im glad youve finally seen the light.Good for you! I grew up afraid of any food I didn't grow up with. In my 30s, I moved to Seattle where my then girlfriend, a foodie, would patiently explain what was in any dish that frightened me. Now, not much scares me. Not even durian.This is what happens when you have an open mind."
542765," Once upon a time, a man from Cherthala in Kerala realised that donating his rare O-ve blood can make a huge difference to someones life. So, he took the path of donating blood as much as he can.Meet PJ Paul who has saved 79 lives from different parts of the state by donating blood, The New Indian Express reports. I used to donate blood every three months till the age of 60. Though I am not suffering from any comorbidities, people above that age are discouraged from donating by doctors, said Paul. Still, he does his bit to help those in need.FilePaul has also formed a group on WhatsApp by the name of 'Negative', where people with rare blood types are members. Paul and his team help people get donors in time.FileIt would be difficult to believe but Paul was an alcoholic almost 30 years ago. ""My addiction even affected my family. My wife, Jonamma, left home with my three-year-old daughter once, he says. The turning point of his life, however, happened when he was least expecting it.I was working as a driver in Alappuzha. One day, I was driving a vehicle with almost 20 pilgrims headed to Sabarimala, and I was intoxicated. The vehicle crashed and though all the passengers were safe, I lost my job. That was the day I quit drinking and decided to start a new life, he says.FileSoon, Paul started working as a driver for a fish distributor. One of my co-workers was looking for a blood donor for her O-negative grandmothers operation. I stepped up, the operation was successful and the happiness of that family gave me a lot of satisfaction. I decided to be a donor since then, he remembers.I came across a one-day-old infant who required 100ml of blood for an immediate operation. I donated blood and she survived. She is 17 now and has never failed to invite me for her birthday, beams Paul.Paul reconciled with his family and started looking for better jobs, landing one in KSEB after a brief stint as a KSRTC driver. Paul, who retired from KSEB in 2015, has currently dedicated his life to blood donation and awareness.For his noble services, Paul has been awarded the best blood donor in the Alappuzha district and was also honoured by the state government as one of the seven best blood donors in the state. Paul believes that donating blood also helps one stay healthy."
542764," The highly infectious and deadly delta variant of coronavirus first detected in India has been spreading across the globe and is said to be on track to become the dominant strain in many countries.One of the biggest concerns the spread of delta strain is causing is its ability to evade the antibodies produced by vaccination.AFPThe effectiveness of the existing vaccines against the delta strain is still being studied across the world.But Gamaleya Research Institute, which developed the Sputnik V has claimed that the Russian-made vaccine has shown more efficiency against the Delta variant than any other vaccine that has published results on this strain so far.BREAKING | RDIF: #SputnikV is more efficient against the Delta variant of coronavirus, first detected in India than any other vaccine that published results on this strain so far - the Gamaleya Center study submitted for publication in an international peer-reviewed journal. V was the first COVID-19 vaccine registered anywhere in the world and the third to be approved for use in India.Dr Reddy's Laboratories, the marketing partner for the vaccine in the country, has been importing the shots from Russia.AgenciesOver a period of time, the vaccine is also going to be manufactured in India.Meanwhile, a study published in The Lancet journal has said that Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines provide good protection against the delta strain.Researchers at Public Health Scotland and the University of Edinburgh, UK, found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine offered better protection against the Delta variant compared to the Oxford-AstraZeneca preventive, known as Covishield in India.File PhotoThe analysis covered the period from April 1 to June 6, 2021, for the demographic distribution of cases.The study found that the Pfizer vaccine offered 79 per cent protection against the Delta strain two weeks after the second dose.For AstraZenecas vaccine, there was 60 per cent protection against Delta.They also found that two doses of vaccine provide much better protection against the Delta variant compared to a single dose.REUTERSRisk of COVID-19 hospital admission was approximately doubled in those with the Delta variant of concern (VOC) when compared to the Alpha VOC, with risk of admission particularly increased in those with five or more relevant comorbidities, the authors of the study noted.Both the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines were effective in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization in people with the Delta VOC, they said."

542761," An Australian state is facing a problem that will make your skin crawl.In many parts of Victoria, blankets of spiderwebs have inundated vast areas after flash floods swept through the region.RedditRecently, the state suffered through heavy storms which triggered floods and forced families to leave their homes.Crawlers usually stick to their nest even during rains and other severe weather conditions. However, now they were having to seek new shelters as their homes were water-logged by the floods.RedditPhotos of the same were shared on Reddit that showed how dense and widespread the cobwebs were.Despite looking like a horror movie, experts say that spiders on the ground can actually do some good to flood-hit areas as they munch on mosquitoes and insects that cause other diseases.RedditA spider keeper from Taronga Zoo told Sydney Morning Herald that spiders do not pose any harm during floods.""The number of mosquitoes around would be incredible because of all this water. The spiders don't pose any harm at all. They are doing us a favour. They are actually helping us out,"" said Brett Finlayson.RedditResidents of Australia's New South Wales were left terrified due to a rodent plague in May. The plague began in March and had an adverse effect on the farming community in the area. The New South Wales government gave them $50 million for the same. Not only that, but they also gave the authorization to use a rather outlawed poison called 'Bromadiolone' to get rid of this menace. But that wasn't the end of their troubles - around the same time, several parts of New South Wales in Australia were hit with severe floods and heavy rains, forcing more than 18,000 people to evacuate their homes. The floods destroyed the nests and habitats of many small creatures - due to that, tens of thousands of spiders and other insects were seen trying to make their way to higher ground to save themselves from the floods."

542758," While the law enforcement officers like the police are there to help the citizens and eliminate any sort of wrong doings that goes against the law, there might be a thin line in knowing what actually is good and bad. There might might be times when these officers end up doing things that seem strange to the rest of us.A case like that happened in Pakistan to an artist by the name of Abuzar Madhu who was looking for a rickshaw at 3am when he was arrested by Lahore Police earlier this month. Why? Well, apparently because his hair was too long. That's right! The artist not only got arrested for that but also spent a night in jail because of the same reason.Abuzar is an artist & a teacher. He was waiting for a Rickshaw near Kalma Chawk when a police van stopped him. They asked for his ID card, which luckily he had. He showed the ID card. The police officer then asked others to put him in the police van Ainu Gaddi wich Pao entire incident was shared on Twitter by Abuzar's friend, Natasha who narrated what exactly happened. In the Twitter thread, it was mentioned that Abuzar was waiting for a rickshaw near Kalma Chawk when a police van stopped him. They asked him for his ID which he showed them and they still arrested him.Abuzar asked the officer what the issue was. The officer continued to threaten and scare him by saying that he will find out the issue once he reaches the police station. That the issue was his Hulia/appearance, his lambay Baal and that he is out on the street at 3 am.Despite the fact that Abuzar kept telling the police that he was an artist and a teacher, they took him to the police station just to teach him a lesson. They checked his bag and only found a few books in it. Even after that, Abuzar had to spend a whole night in jail just because he had long hair.However, before getting his phone confiscated, Abuzar had asked a few friends for help and they got him out the next morning.Natasha, in her tweets seemed furious and asked why the police misused their power and harassed and bullied a teacher, an artist, a law-abiding citizen for no apparent reason?To protect actually operating to threaten us? Saifullah knew he can threaten Abuzar & get away with it. That this is some sort of twisted and fucked up power high. That he wont face any consequences for bullying a citizen. That he is confirming the fear we have from the police.Many others also supported Abuzar and questioned this incident.I am a former student of Sir Abuzar. He was one of the kindest souls i have ever met. There is no justification to his arrest. This is bullshit, he did nothing wrongThanks for sharing. The fear of authority and power is so normal for a common man. It is this fear that inhibits free thinking and progress. Institutions and people need a course correction. Wonder how?Omg this is horrifying so sorry your friend had to go through this.He came as a trainer to one of our trainings and what a guy he is. One of the most peaceful & unproblematic people i have ever met. What is wrong with our police???? disheartening to see how some people still choose to control someone's way of living."

542749," The lockdowns have been tough, be it in 2020 or 2021. The tough restrictions imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19 have not spared anyone, but the travel and tourism sector which entirely depends on people being able to move around has been among the worst hit.And it has had a devastating impact on those whose livelihoods depend on the industry and the economies of such states.BCCLSo it should not come as a surprise that tourism dependent states are eager to open up.In 2021, Himachal Pradesh, the state known for hill stations like Kullu-Manali, Shimla, Dalhousie, etc was the first to open up.While the state did not explicitly say that tourists are welcome, on Friday, Himachal Pradesh lifted Section 144 in the state and tweaked its COVID-19 guidelines, and said that a negative RT-PCR test is no longer required to cross the state borders. Anyone with an e-pass is now allowed to enter the state.PTIAnd the result of this change was evident in the next few days, which was a weekend.Thousands of cars were seen lining up at Parwanoo, the Solan districts entry point, mostly tourists from neighbouring states.According to Mohit Chawla, Superintendent of Police, Shimla, at least 5,000 vehicles entered Shimla from the Shoghi barrier on Saturday and Sunday.""There is a huge influx of tourists after the state government relaxed COVID guidelines. We anticipated the increase in the tourist movement during the weekend, but what is heartening to note is that people are following COVID protocols,"" he said.The state is seeing an influx of visitors at a time when the number of COVID-19 cases in Himachal is on a downward slide.REUTERSBut there is a fear that with the majority of the population still not vaccinated, the state may be rushing to open up.In 2020 too, Himachal Pradesh was one of the first states to open up for tourism after the lockdown restrictions were eased.Other tourism-driven economies like Goa, Uttarakhand, Kerala also followed suit.But once the number of COVID-19 cases started spiraling out of control, these states were late to act.Goa in particular was badly hit. The beach state which was largely spared during the first wave of COVID-19 was partying like there is no tomorrow, especially during the Diwali Weeknd and Christmas-New Year. Though social distancing norms were in place, it was hardly followed and there was no way to enforce them among the visitors.BCCLIn March, by the time when Goa realized what hit them it was too late. The state had to go into prolonged lockdowns, and at one point had a test positivity rate of over 50 per cent.Given what the state had to go through, Goa, while is keen to open up for tourists, is taking a more cautious approach.With a coupe of months left for the tourism season to start, state Tourism Minister Manohar Ajgaonkar has said that such activities should resume there only after the entire population of the coastal state is completely vaccinated against COVID-19.""We can't keep Goa's tourism industry shut forever, as it is an important backbone of our state's economy,"" Ajgaonkar said.BCCLThe tourism industry can resume all its activities once the entire population of the state is ""fully vaccinated"" with both doses of the vaccines, he said.According to the minister only tourists who are ""fully vaccinated"" should be allowed to enter the state.Another state, Kerala too is taking a similar approach. Monsoon, one of Kerala's busiest tourist seasons underway, that state is still reeling under COVID-19.The state tourism sector had incurred losses to the tune of Rs 33,675 crore due to the COVID-19 situation.bcclAll popular holiday destinations in Kerala may soon be declared as complete ""vaccinated zones"" as the state government is mulling to provide the COVID-19 jab to everyone in the tourism sector.""We are mulling to make famous tourist destinations in the state 100 per cent vaccinated zones by July 15 with the support of the health department,"" Tourism minister P A Mohammed Riyas said."

542736," From the increasing frequency of droughts, heavy rains, floods, and cyclones, India has been on the receiving end of many extreme weather events in recent years and experts have predicted that the number of such incidents is only going to go up in the coming years.Climate change and global warming have been partly blamed for the increase in such extreme weather events in the Indian subcontinent.BCCLWhile India is one of the worst affected, the country's contribution to climate change has been minimal.India's contribution to climate change in the last 200 years has been only three per cent, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar has said, adding that unbridled carbon emissions especially by Europe and the US over the last 200 years, and in the last 40 years by China have caused the climate change disaster.Developed nations owe USD 1.1 trillion to developing nations as a part of climate change mitigation under the Paris Agreement, and this was discussed at the G7 Summit, which concluded on Sunday, Javadekar said at the virtual 'Environment Conclave: Revival, Regeneration and Conservation of Nature'.""India is one of the countries with the least contribution in climate change,"" Javadekar said.PTISpeaking about the steps taken by the government to combat air pollution, Javadekar said the adoption of the zig-zag technology in 3,000 out of 6,000 brick kilns around the NCR has also helped in reduction of air pollution.In zig-zag kilns, bricks are arranged to allow hot air to travel in a zigzag path which results in better mixing of air and fuel, allows complete combustion, reducing coal consumption by about 20 per cent.Javadekar added that the central government is also taking steps to ensure the country becomes free of single-use plastic by next year.According to a recent study, if global warming continues unchecked, summer monsoon rainfall in India will become stronger and more erratic. This is the central finding of an analysis by a team of researchers that compared more than 30 state-of-the-art climate models from all around the world.BCCLThe study predicts more extremely wet years in the future - with potentially grave consequences for more than one billion people's well-being, economy, food systems and agriculture.""We have found robust evidence for an exponential dependence: For every degree Celsius of warming, monsoon rainfalls will likely increase by about 5%,"" said lead author Anja Katzenberger from the Potsdam-Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich, Germany (LMU).BCCL""We see more and more that climate change is about unpredictable weather extremes and their serious consequences,"" said group leader and co-author Anders Levermann from PIK and Columbia University, New York."

However, what makes this special is that the snail was captured while giving birth, with five offsprings also trapped in it. According to researchers, it showcases the earliest known fossilized incidents of birth in snails.The kids appear to be still connected to their mother by a trail of mucus. Evolutionary biologist Adrienne Jochum of the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum Frankfurt explained, The snails were apparently encased in the tree resin immediately after birth and preserved in that position over millions of years. The mother snail must have noticed her impending fate and is stretching her tentacles up in a 'red alert' posture.Jochum added, Just like their modern relatives from the genus Cyclophoridae, our new discovery probably spent its life inconspicuously on dead and rotting leaves. We assume that the young of this species  compared to egg-laying snails  were smaller and lower in number to increase their chance of survival.High-resolution photographs and CT scans helped the team to find that the mother was a newly discovered species of cyclopoid that they named Cretatortulosa gignens -- the latin for giving birth. The shell was small -- around just half an inch in size.Also Read: Indian Scientists Find A Rare, 157 Million Year Old Dinosaur Fossil In Gujarat's Kutch DesertAccording to the researchers, the creature may have evolved to birth the child alive to protect it as long as possible in the tropical forests of the Cretaceous.Representational Image: Associate Professor Lida Xing, China University of Geosciences, Beijing.Also Read: Largest Animal Ever To Walk On Earth Has Probably Been Found In ArgentinaApart from finding the snail giving birth thats already an extremely rare case, they were also captured as fossilized shells that meant the insides of the amber would still have soft bodies of the snails, which is also rare to find.What do you feel about this rare discovery?

542723," Lagaan is not just a film its a feeling. The film that released exactly 20 years ago has left so many emotions behind that it will be remembered till eternity. Every actor in that film is a legend including Aamir Khan.TwitterToday he gives all the credits to that one film that has shaped in so many ways as an actor. On the 20 years of Lagaan, Aamir in an interaction with IANS, he said,TwitterFurther adding the actor even thanked the filmmaker for making him a part of this beautiful journey,In this journey, I want to thank, Ashu, the entire team of Lagaan, all the different teams that took it to the various audiences across the world, and all of you who have seen the film. We have all come together in this journey, some early, some later as we went along, but all of us are fellow travellers.TwitterThis film directed by Ashutosh Gowariker is special for so many reasons. Lagaan was set in 1893 during the late Victorian period of Indias colonial British Raj. The story revolved around the small village in Central India, whose inhabitants, burdened by high taxes accept a challenge to play a cricket match against a team of British officers. If they win the match their taxes would be excused but failing to win would have made them triple amount of tax.No wonder today cricket is not just a game, but a religion."
542722," In a move that is a potential hazard to protected wildlife in Uttarakhand, the state government has given a nod to construct a 4.7 kilometre long road connecting the Corbett and the Rajaji tiger reserve.The road threatens the habitats of tigers and elephants in the country.The project had been blocked since 2019 but has now received an approval of the National Board of Wildlife (NBWL).BCCL/ Representational ImageIt was earlier stalled due to clearance issues and exemptions, as demanded by the state. However, as the best mitigation planning, an inspection team recommends 'avoiding' the project.According to a release by the CMO, two points in the forest patch- Laldhang and Chilarkhal will be connected by the entire road.Environmentalists and activists are happy with the construction of road in the forest area.They fear that building a road may disrupt wildlife habitat along with migration routes. The rise in traffic will also create disturbance for tigers, elephants, deer, and others in these forests.ReutersThe grasslands from the Himalayan foothills, the Terai delta, that extend from Corbett to Palamu in Jharkhand and beyond to Assam are the productive habitat for tigers and large ungulates in all of Asia. Tiger populations reach their highest densities in these rich habitats, especially like Corbett and Kaziranga, tiger conservationist K Ullas Karanth told The Times of India."
542721," Disclaimer: Do not try this at home.Achieving certain feats can sometimes make people push beyond their limits - the former world's strongest man faced an obstacle when he tried to leg press a little too much weight.The heavyweight champion, Eddie Hall, is a British strongman and the winner of the 2017 World's Strongest Man competition. He also holds the official deadlift world record of pulling 500 kgs under strongman rules in 2016.YouTubeA video shows Eddie doing some back squats before moving to the leg press machine. In the clip, it shows that Eddie has set a goal for himself and wants to go for 1,000 kg - the heaviest leg press attempt of his life.Simply put, pushing a 1,000 kg press is like pushing a saltwater crocodile or an adult polar bear with your legs.The video shows him starting his workout and slowly adding more weight. After a few presses, ""I soiled myself. Do you smell it?""He doesn't give up and continues to reach his target.However, after a few seconds, his eyes close and his head drops to the side. He wakes up and then he says, ""Did I pass out?""The video was shared on Eddie's official YouTube channel that has over 1.8 million followers.He captioned the video: ""PASSED OUT DOING 1000KG LEG PRESS!""Even though bodybuilders are used to lifting heavy weights on a regular basis, experts advise that bench presses and leg presses should only be done keeping in mind the person's physical limits.However, Eddie is used to deadlifting - he has challenged himself many times before just to lift some weights.Back in 2006, Eddie passed out after deadlifting 500kgs at the First Direct Arena in Leeds.""That nearly killed me. The pressure on my body was surreal. I passed out after. I had nose bleeds. It's not healthy doing something like that,"" he had said at the time.YouTubeWhat do you think of this video?

542720," Just days after a preliminary probe by the Uttarakhand health department suggested that many of the four lakh Covid test results issued during the Kumbh festival in Haridwar were fake, a detailed investigation  running into 1,600 pages and accessed by TOI  has found that at least 1 lakh test reports were forged by a private agency.In one instance, a single phone number was used to register over 50 people while one antigen test kit (which has an exclusive number and is meant for single use) was shown to have tested 700 samples.ANIAddresses and names were fictional. Almost 530 samples were taken from House Number 5 in Haridwar. Is it possible for a house to have over 500 residents? Bizarre addresses have been given  House number 56 Aligarh, House number 76 Mumbai, an official who is part of the investigation told TOI. The official added, Phone numbers were fake too. People in Kanpur, Mumbai, Ahmedabad and 18 other locations shared the same phone number.Arjun Singh Sengar, Kumbh Mela health officer, told TOI, The agency was supposed to submit the samples to two private labs. The labs are also under probe. As per health secretary Amit Negi, the report has been forwarded to the Haridwar DM.ReutersSeveral irregularities have been found. We will take action after receiving a detailed report from the DM in15 days, said Negi. Haridwar DM C Ravishnkar said he was probing the matter and pending payment of all agencies has been put on hold until further notice.An official said the 200 sample collectors employed by the agency turned out to be students and data entry operators in Rajasthan, who had never been to Haridwar.A sample collector has to be physically present to collect samples, he said. One sample collector was someone enrolled in a skill development training programme at a government authorised centre in Hanumangarh (Rajasthan). Upon inquiry, he told us that he had never been to Kumbh. He said he had been given the data by his instructor who had asked him to upload it as part of his training, according to the report.AFPAs per officials, this is just the tip of the iceberg since eight more sample collection agencies were tasked to conduct tests by the state government after the HC directed Uttarakhand to carry out at least 50,000 tests daily during Kumbh. The festival was held from April 1 to 30 in Haridwar. The four lakh tests in this period were conducted by nine agencies and 22 private labs.Majority of these tests were antigen tests. The state department also conducted its own tests through government labs. Of the 1 lakh tests conducted by the agency under scanner, 177 were Covid positive  a positivity rate of only 0.18%. In contrast, the positivity rate in Haridwar in April went upto 10%.The agency was paid Rs 350 per antigen test and higher for RT-PCR tests, which means the scam runs into crores. Test results by other agencies are also being probed now, said a health department official."
542718," Bhutan has been doing a commendable job when it comes to handling the pandemic. The country has been taking strict precautions and has proved how for the government, the wellbeing of the citizens always comes first. According to several reports, the country has an average of 18 new Covid-19 infections per day and the country has seen just 1 death since the beginning of the pandemic. But, one can't just praise the government for taking care of the pandemic. The King of Bhutan Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck has also been personally making sure that all the precautions are followed properly.In a now viral tweet, it was disclosed that to ensure people's safety the king himself trekked for 5 days in Bhutan's eastern border areas to check illegal crossings that could increase the spread of COVID-19.The tweet was shared by Tenzing Lamsang, the President of the Media Association of Bhutan. He along with the details shared a few pictures of the king who is taking his 14th or 15th trip to the borders since the beginning of the pandemic.His Majesty The King trekked 5 days in Bhutans eastern border areas through forests, rain, high passes & leeches to check on border posts put up to check illegal crossings to prevent COVID-19.This is his 14th or 15th trip since pandemic started.Accompanied by PM this time. tweet also mentioned how the king has rarely been home and has been patrolling since the pandemic began even though he has a 5-year-old and a newborn kid at home.This picture below is almost a month long trip to Bhutans thickly forested southern border areas which His Majesty had just completed recently. His Majesty has a 5-year-old and a new born at home but has rarely got the chance to see them since the first case in March 2020. people on the internet praised the king and his governance in the country of Bhutan.Inspirational...Bhutan..if all countries worked n lived this wayAlas! If we could have an opportunity to live in Bhutan and more importantly under such a ruler who really cares.You people are fortunate enough to born in such a beautiful country .

542717," The death of a 68-year-old man due to anaphylaxis has been confirmed as the first fatality in India after taking the COVID-19 vaccine.According to reports, the 68-year-old had taken the vaccine in March and died of anaphylaxis as a result of Serious Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI).BCCLThe AEFI committee headed by Dr NK Arora also found that between February and March, 28 people died after getting a dose during this period but most appeared not to have been linked, while the cause could not be determined in at least 9 of them.The committee also said that 3 cases were found to be vaccine product related.As per the government data, there have been 26,000 cases of adverse events following COVID vaccination and 488 deaths linked to post-vaccine complications between January 16 and June 7.In the same period, 23.5 crore doses were administered in the country.AFP""Mere reporting of deaths and hospitalizations as serious adverse events does not automatically imply that the events were caused due to vaccines. Only properly conducted investigations and causality assessments can help in understanding if any causal relationship exists between the event and the vaccine. For causality assessments, priority has been given to death cases,"" the report said.Last month the National AEFI Committee had said that incidents of bleeding or clotting following Covid-19 vaccination in India are minuscule and in line with the expected number of diagnoses of these conditions in the country.AFPThe reporting rate of these events in India is around 0.61 per million doses, which is much lower than the four cases per million reported by the UK's regulator Medical and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA). Germany has reported 10 events per million doses.Thromboembolic events keep occurring in general population as background and scientific literature suggests that this risk is almost 70 per cent less in persons of South and South East Asian descent in comparison to those from Europe."
542713," It has been almost a year and a half since we have been fighting the deadly COVID-19 outbreak. It is only fair to say that we have all been anxious, overwhelmed, stressed, depressed or grief-stricken at some point into the pandemic. You, I and the medical community alike. But somehow, we haven't really spoken about mental health of healthcare workers as much as we should have.Working on the frontline of the pandemic, care and health workers especially face a wide range of psychological stressors, which may cause both long-lasting effects to the well-being and mental health of workers and affect the quality and safety of the care they provide.Indiatimes will hold a webinar in collaboration with 'Headspace' on 17 June, 2021 on mental health and effects a pandemic can have on our doctors, nurses, hospital staff and medical workers. During the discussion, the primary talking point would be how doctors are called 'COVID warriors' and given that respect only when nothing goes wrong. At other unfortunate times, they are beaten up, abused and disrespected.We are going to speak to Dr Samir Parikh, Director Of Mental Health & Behavioural Sciences on the need to see how society's response towards healthcare practice needs to be. We will further speak about violence and trolling medical industry goes through.I believe it is absolutely true. We seldom talk about mental health of doctors, let alone the care that our nurses and other medical workers deserve.A short film produced by the WHO Regional Office for Europe also shows health care workers talking about the mental health and well-being challenges they have been facing while caring for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.Beyond the physical impact of the pandemic on societies worldwide, studies are warning of the negative effects on peoples mental health. The main psychological consequences to date appear to be elevated levels of stress or anxiety, loneliness, insomnia, and depression.In the film, health workers share their pain over losing patients and emphasise the importance of supporting one another and how the demands of their jobs have taken a toll on their mental health and well-being, resulting in feelings of guilt, worry and stress, insomnia, nightmares, stigma and discrimination.Another point worth highlighting is that the first wave was more of figuring out how to tackle COVID-19 and second one was actually more of implementation of the learnings. So, through the application of newly learnt medical procedures, it becomes difficult to reflect on your own self, and therefore, the self care becomes tougher.There is a sense of empathy health professionals carry. But the kind of devastation that the health workers have seen through the last one and a half year and now especially the second wave, there can be compassion fatigue on the part of doctors.We will also speak to Dr Anant Bhan, Adjunct Visiting Professor in the Centre for Ethics, Yenepoya University, Mangaluru on how sometimes doctors do not have the time to reflect on the loss of patient's family.The experts' panel will also be joined Dr Pratima Murthy from NIMHANS and Ms Sarah Romotsky, RD, Director, Healthcare Partnership Solutions, Headspace. They will share their understanding of the situation with the viewers.Ms Romotsky, with her experience in self care for medical professionals, is expected to further elucidate the topic with her insight and suggestions. Her views on inducting mindfulness in daily routine is what the viewers can benefit from.Do medical professionals deserve a break? Finding answer to this question has led to several prolonged discussion as the medical practice involves both expertise and ethics. Dr Pratima would be there to intervene with her nuanced understanding of the doctors' dilemma.Speaking of protection of health and care workers mental health, it is important to note that many of the doctors had to self isolate. They were living away from their families in order to protect them from the virus, and that is something which isn't taught in medical schools.The doctors were also not taught how to deal with a pandemic. There is no professional course that comes with a manual on tackling a crisis as such. It is taxing, it requires time, patience and extreme gratitude on our end as a society to enable our health professionals the care they need.Due to a variety of healthcare challenges that we face now, it becomes imperative for the authorities to develop a special program for the healthcare workers, where their metal health is taken care of."

The image shows a straight green light entering right at the top of the volcano, amidst thick grey-black clouds, making most of us think what the explosion would have looked like. However, according to Song, it didnt make any noise when the green light hit the volcano.We already know that when a meteor enters Earths atmosphere, it comes in contact with immense heat -- thats why shuttles coming down from the international space station are equipped with heat shields to prevent them from melting and disintegrating, Meteors dont have such heat shields, so they burn up.Also Read: Green Meteors Look Amazing From Anywhere, Be It South India Or AustraliaPrasanjeet YadavAnd meteors normally contain different kinds of minerals or metals.

542704," On June 15, 2001, Lagaan was released in theatres all over India. It would also be our official entry into the Oscars in 2002. 20 years on, it remains a cult classic.Of course, the main attraction is the cricket match. For a movie nearly 4 hours long, almost 90 minutes of cricket is played and that is roughly half a T20 match. Now while it was an entertainer, in the euphoria of creativity, some facts were wrong.Now, remember that while the movie came out in 2001, the film is set in 1893. So where did the filmmakers got wrong?The StatesmanNow while as many as fifteen mistakes can be found, let's just focus on the more prominent ones.Six-ball overs look ok, right? Wrong! Back then the Englishmen played 8-ball overs. In South Africa five-ball overs were prevalent and the Aussies used six-ball overs. But one would not expect the English to use that method and yet the game saw just that.Then comes the case of the missing delivery. When Tipu gets run out by the bowler without delivering the ball, the ball is counted. That should not be the case as the ball was never bowled in the first place.Even the one innings per side concept was something that did not happen then.

542703," Toxic foams seen floating in river Yamuna have become a not so rare occurrence in Delhi and one of the reasons blamed for it is the discharge of chemicals from soaps and detergents to the water from households.According to an official of the Central Pollution Control Board, the primary reason behind the formation of the toxic foam in the Yamuna high phosphate content in the wastewater because of detergents used in dyeing industries, dhobi ghats and households.AFPThese detergents and other organic matter gets deposited in the riverbed when the river is flowing normally.When water falls from a height on reaching a barrage, it leads to turbulence and churning which causes froth.Earlier this year, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had in January accepted recommendations of a two-member expert panel which had suggested directing the Delhi government to issue orders ""prohibiting sale, storage and transportation and marketing of detergents which do not conform to the revised BIS standards"".AFPThe NGT had also directed to launch awareness campaigns about the harmful effect of using substandard soaps and detergents.On Monday, the Delhi Government banned the sale, storage, transportation, and marketing of soaps and detergents not conforming to the latest BIS standards in the national capital.Yamuna has been one of the most polluted rivers in India thanks to the unchecked discharge of both sewage and industrial waste to the waterbody for many years.Though the quality of the water and oxygen level in the Yamuna had substantially improved last year during the first lockdown, it began deteriorating after the restrictions were lifted.BCCL/ FILEIn January, the Delhi government had prepared a nine-point action plan to prevent frothing in the Yamuna river due to the discharge of untreated sewage in the river. The plan, approved by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), lays down targets to be achieved by various agencies, including the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and municipal corporations, to prevent the discharge of untreated wastewater in the river.According to the plan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have been asked to upgrade their sewage treatment plants (STPs) to standards prescribed by the DPCC for treating the wastewater entering the Yamuna through Najafgarh drain and Hindon cut canal.AFPLast month, the Master Plan Delhi 2041 had proposed identifying specific locations for permitting agriculture on the floodplains of the Yamuna.In January 2015, the NGT had banned farming on the Yamuna floodplains, saying the vegetables grown there were ""highly contaminated"" and their consumption could lead to cancer.In July 2019, a two-member panel appointed by the NGT to monitor pollution in the river recommended that farmers may be allowed to grow crops and vegetables but with regular and constant watch on metal content and pesticides levels in the harvested produce."

542695," The highly transmissible Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 has mutated even more to create the Delta plus or AY.1 variant but there's no reason for alarm at this point in India as its incidence in the country is still low, scientists said as per PTI. The new Delta plus variant is a result of a mutation in the Delta or B.1.617.2 variant, first identified in India and one of the drivers of the deadly second wave. Though nothing indicates any severity of the disease due to the new variant, Delta plus is resistant to the monoclonal antibody cocktail treatment for COVID-19 recently authorised in India.AgenciesThe mutation is in the spike protein of SARS-COV-2, which helps it infect human cells. Public Health England said 63 genomes of Delta (B.1.617.2) with the new K417N mutation have been identified so far on the global science initiative GISAID. In its latest report on coronavirus variants, updated till last Friday, the health agency said Delta plus was present in six genomes from India as per the latest information available on June 7.The earliest sequence of this genome was found in Europe in late March this year. Noting that the travel histories for the variant are not readily available to make assumptions, Mr Scaria said an important point to consider regarding K417N is the evidence suggesting resistance to monoclonal antibodies Casirivimab and Imdevimab. This cocktail recently received emergency-use authorization in the country from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation. Drug majors Roche India and Ciplas have priced the antibody cocktail at a steep Rs. 59,750 per dose.GettySimilar to antibodies which are proteins that the body naturally produces to defend itself against the disease, monoclonal antibodies are artificially created in a lab and tailor-made to fight the disease they treat. Casirivimab and Imdevimab are monoclonal antibodies that are specifically directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, and designed to block the virus attachment and entry into human cells.Scaria also indicated the mutation may be associated with the ability to escape the immune response against the virus. Allaying fears, immunologist Vineeta Bal noted that while there may be some setback in the use of commercial antibody cocktail due to the new variant, resistance to the therapy is not an indication of higher virulence or severity of a disease.""How transmissible this new variant is will be a crucial factor to determine its rapid spread or otherwise,"" Bal, guest faculty at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune, told PTI.Getty""There is no cause of concern due to the new variant in India as of now, Agrawal, the director of CSIR-IGIB,"" told PTI.The scientist said the blood plasma from many fully vaccinated individuals will have to be tested against this variant to determine whether it shows any significant immune escape. As the Delta variant continues to evolve and acquire new mutations, there is a lot of interest in understanding its evolution. He said SARS-CoV-2 has a nearly constant rate of acquiring genetic variants, and each variant has acquired additional variants in a stepwise fashion."

542661," It has been a year since we lost a star, Sushant Singh Rajput, and there are several questions that remain unanswered.

542660," Earlier this month, Skylo, a satellite-based IoT solution company, announced a partnership with UK-based Inmarsat, a company thats been providing satellite-to-Earth communication for over four decades. The deal is unique because it makes IoT-over-satellite a scalable solution for the first time in a place like India.Skylo will help connect all kinds of machines and sensors -- that are difficult to connect and monitor in real-time over terrestrial networks -- through geostationary Inmarsat satellites located 35,000 kilometers in space.Skylo satellite communication appThis allows everything from managing vaccine efficacy during delivery, to advancing precision farming, to providing early warnings in the event of natural disasters, said Parth Trivedi, Co-founder and CEO of Skylo.Hes focused on making the Skylo platform available to small and large enterprises, governments and OEMs. We spoke to Parth Trivedi to understand Skylos innovation and its current deployment in India with a partnership with BSNL.Parth: I'm trained as an aerospace engineer from Purdue and MIT, but Im actually from Kolkata -- spent the first 17 years of my life there. And at MIT, I was funded by the Department of Defense and NASA, plus the airforce and worked on several different projects for the US Government. I also served on the UN delegation to ICAO, which is the global body on aviation and connectivity before coming to Stanford. At Stanford, I had the honor of having folks like Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google at the time, as my faculty members.Skylo co-founder and CEO, Parth Trivedi (in centre)I teamed up with Professor Andrew Kalman, who is widely regarded as one of the original founders of the small satellite revolution that is now taking over the world, to make access to space affordable and commoditized. We're essentially built and designed around connecting people, not connecting machines, especially machines that have to operate, live and thrive in remote areas that humans often don't live in.Parth: As the world embarks on digitizing everything, the key question becomes, how do we fundamentally get data out of these devices and into the cloud? How can people draw useful insights from that data? When we talk about ubiquitous connectivity, which is connecting machines, not people, that cost has not fallen at all. If I wanted to connect a remote sensor out in the middle of nowhere, I would be paying thousands of dollars in hardware cost and hundreds of dollars in recurring operational cost to even set up that network. And as 5G rolls along, networks are only becoming denser, they're not becoming broader in coverage.Skylos fundamental breakthrough was creating revolutionary hardware for ubiquitous connectivity at a disruptively low price point, coupled with a network which was completely software defined. Think about it as a self-configuring intelligent gateway, on the one end, which is very comparable to maybe a Wi-Fi hotspot that you would use personally, right? And on the other end, we have a network that can access satellites, allowing us to transport data, irrespective of where your machines and devices are. So, we built that capability that allows you as a customer to experience magical connectivity, no matter where you are. And because our network is completely cloud based, its a software defined application layer that allows you to access powerful analytics from your machines and from your sensors, along with developer friendly APIs under a single solution that collects data across any machine or sensor in real-time.Skylo hub on Indian fishing vesselSo, that is the fundamental problem that Skylo solves. Your assets are always on, always transporting data, whether it's a truck, transporting the COVID vaccine with a temperature sensor or whether it's getting fresh produce. Each and every industry that data touches is going to be rapidly transformed once an analog process moves over to a digital process. And that's the change that Skylo is fundamentally bringing about.Parth: I had a rare opportunity to meet Prime Minister Modi in 2015. And he actually invited us to consider India as our pilot market, which was music to our ears, because we were also thinking about India as our first market. That's what led to us forming a contract, officially, as a partner to BSNL which is owned 100% by the government, in under 12 months from start to finish, which we just announced publicly in January.During market exploration, Indian fisheries was really one example that jumped off the page. There are anywhere between 250,000 to 400,000 fishing vessels in India, depending on which statistics you look at. In fact, in the Indian Ocean there are about 4.5 million fishing vessels, so there's a massive base of unconnected boats at sea.I mean hats off to our fishermen for navigating waters without any modern equipment. They literally are using celestial bodies to navigate. Of course, now many of them have GPS which allows them to know where they are with respect to the course but it doesn't allow them to send their location to anybody if they need help.Skylo's Hub on Indian fishing boatAnd so the need was very pressing, because overall the government and all the stakeholders are looking at coastal security. We met everyone from the fishing sector, the fishermen, the fleet owners, the fisheries associations, all the way to the Secretary GOI Fisheries. We figured out how our solution can best address their needs and equipped fishermen with Skylo mobile app that pairs over Bluetooth and supports 13 different Indian languages. It gives fishermen access to Whatsapp style messaging, location data, IoT sensor data like temperature so fish doesnt spoil. And, of course, an SOS capability, which is what was used by the fishermen who had this installed on their boat recently. Indian Coast Guard actually used our platform at the time to find the boat and rescue the fishermen stranded at sea.Parth: We have 31 patents filed around IP that allows us to recognize that machines have a very different profile of communications than human users. Vodafone or any other telco, for example, doesn't really know when you're about to make a call, so a lot of their capacity and overhead goes into anticipating you making a call. But for Skylo dealing with machine-to-machine communication over satellites, I know exactly when that boat is transmitting its location once every five minutes or once every 10 minutes, and our network can be optimized dynamically. That is the cost savings we pass on to our end users.In terms of our hardware itself, think of all the equipment inside media vans that carry modular satellite dishes on top? We have actually shrunk all of that into the form factor of a single printed circuit board. Our Skylo hub is essentially a 6-inch-by-6-inch antenna inside a printed circuit board thats completely flat. With just that, you're able to now communicate over satellite with digital beamforming. Take it out of your backpack, turn it and youre online via satellite in less than 10 minutes. Its designed according to military grade specifications, so its dust proof, waterproof, and so on.Exploded view of Skylo hub unitThis is what allows us to become highly affordable and highly scalable as a service across the board. In fact, if you want, you can take our reference design and start manufacturing our hubs as well, customize them to your spec, and we invite the entire industry to manufacture this across the board. In fact, the current Skylo hub is entirely manufactured in Manesar, India. We have successfully tested our service at 18,000 feet in Ladakh at minus 34 degrees Celsius. It works perfectly in snow, in rain, irrespective of what the weather is or where you are, customers are being connected.Parth: We haven't really released a formal developer program yet, though we will. We started out with the maritime and fisheries sector in India, but we also did logistics. In logistics, of course, any kind of tracking of your assets, irrespective of where they are, that was key. So, we focused on essentially these three things to start out with in the business. What we learned was how customers are using this capability in new ways.Skylo hub on truck topsAs I mentioned to you, in agriculture, many farms, including perhaps my own ancestors farms in Kutch, are still unmechanized because the majority of farmers can't afford to buy a tractor, since the land holding is so small. Think of private distributors and the government starting to rent out these tractors in an Uber or Ola model to farmers. How 300 million farmers who didn't have access to mechanization, suddenly have access to mechanization for maybe a few 100 rupees per acre, and it completely changes the game in terms of your yield, how much profitability you can have per acre of your farm, and then the returns for farmers is incredible.For tractor owners, they're not only monetizing it, theyre giving the opportunity for that asset to benefit so many others. It requires geo fencing, it requires a very accurate calculation of how many acres the tractors have farmed, it requires fuel consumption calculation, in case there is an issue, the farmer should be able to communicate back to the dealer or the distributor that, you know, that theyre in trouble, they need a replacement. These are the practical applications that Skylo is bringing online in the agriculture sector.When we talk about logistics, we have customers that are using Skylo on ambulances, because they want to ensure that patients that are inbound into the ICU are constantly tracked, and we ensure that the ICU is ready, theres visibility across the board from the hospital down to the operator. So, primary health care centers are being connected, where Asha workers are now able to transmit messages on, you know, vaccination records, etc, over the network in places like Champaran, deep inside rural areas completely devoid of connectivity. And that's very, very motivating for me personally, that we were able to serve such use cases.Skylo hub working in -34 degrees celsius in LadakhSmart cities, I think, is an overused term perhaps, but Municipal Corporations now are starting to use Skylo on solid waste management assets. So, trucks and these equipment that basically take care of solid waste management across the city, they are customers of ours, and they're using Skylo to manage their fleets and ensure that their own respective Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan happens effectively.Parth: We have not published our pricing, as it varies depending on how many data operations you're conducting by the minute. I can give you a rough sense, the sort of total installed cost of the solution, the hardware, etc, is less than Rs 10,000.Parth: Covid has been unfortunate to our species in so many ways, but in some areas, it has completely changed the way we think about work about industrial operations. Now the importance of remote connectivity, and being able to have visibility into what's going on in your business operations so that sitting at home in Vikhroli, or wherever you may be, you can monitor exactly what's going on in your mine in Orissa or your oil wellhead, you know, deep in Manipur, you are now becoming essentially omnipresent with this capability. And that omnipresence is so important for customers now more than ever before.Very soon, we want to give our hub to each technical university in the country, so that students can build a forest fire detection app over the weekend or other innovative use cases. In fact, my team member built an air quality monitor just in a few hours through our solution.Parth: Im an Indian citizen, and just passionate about doing something good for our country at the end of the day. And to me, that's what drives me every single morning. This is where the rubber really hits the road. If you can make it in India, you can make it anywhere in the world. If you have satisfied and happy customers, at the end of the day, you know your business can conquer all challenges and set the new standard for IoT worldwide."

This is according to research published in the journal Nature.Representational Image: Getty ImagesAlso Read: Microsoft President Warns World To Have Laws To Control AI Before It's Too LateThe study highlights that humans can take months to design special chips for their TPUs or Tensor Processing Units, but Reinforcement Learning or RL algorithm is more efficient and impactful in creating more sophisticated AI.In fact, according to Google, the chips made by the AI are already being used commercially in the latest version of tensor processing unit chips.Google researchers first made the software analyse 10,000 chip floor plans (where CPUs, GPUs and memory are placed on the silicon) and then asked the AI to come up with floor plans that did not use more space, wire and electric power, compared to those made by humans.As per the research, since the 1960s there have been three different kinds of approaches for laying the silicon -- partitioning-based methods, stochastic/hill-climbing approaches and analytic solvers. However, none have been able to surpass the performance level of a human, until the RL system.Also Read: Physicist's AI Algorithm Could Prove Our Reality Is Just A SimulationAccording to the researchers, their method can scale to netlists with millions of nodes and optimize for any mixture of differentiable and non-differentiable cost functions.

She always stood out in her commercials - infact rose into prominence with her Fair & Lovely adverts - even when they got her embroiled into controversies. Not many who make it venture into television make it big into showbiz but then Yami Gautam proved otherwise.The actress recently got married to filmmaker Aditya Dhar and has been getting appreciated for her simple Himachali wedding by eben Kangana Ranaut. While some called her real, some called her a true Pahadi dulhan. Not just off-screen, her journey on-screen has been wonderful too.Let's take a look at her acting journey and wish we can see more of her. Yami might have become the face of Fair and Lovely, now Glow and Lovely which recieved backlash at several times but for her performances, Yami has always been loved by her audience.1. Chand Ke Paar ChaloTwitterIt all started with a TV serial. Yes, this series marked the acting debut of the actors Yami Gautam as Sana who is beautiful but also very quiet & serious. When Yami was figuring her way into showbiz, she caught hold of a prime time show which turned out to be immensely successful.2. Vicky DonorscreengrabThe concept was based on sperm donation and infertility and Ayushmann Khurrana became a star overnight but one cannot forget the dramatic Punjabi-Bengali households. Yami's role as Bengali girl working in a bank and her performance was appreciated widely. The film won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment at the 60th National Film Awards and truly kickstarted Yami's career on silver screen.3. BadlapurscreengrabYami might have played a supporting role but the plot primarily revolves around her. The emotional angle she gets with her character is heartbreaking. And just like her previous film Vicky Donor, Badlapur too recieved several accolades and awards. Speaking about his co-star, Varun Dhawan had earlier said, ""My first meeting with her was weird. Director Sriram Raghavan had asked me to develop a comfort level with her. She was doing her fittings when I met her for the first time and I asked her if we could spend some time together. She was baffled. But I developed an instant fondness for her. If I had to have a wife, she would be like her. I felt I was married to Yami.""4. Sanam ReYami Gautam/FCI mean just look at her dressed up like a school girl. Well, only Yami can! Taking a break from serious roles, Yami went onto do a fun romantic drama film with Pulkit Samrat and Urvashi Rautela. The film didn't make money at the box office but Yami's role was applauded.5. KaabilInstagramYami's choice of movies have always been interesting. Starring opposite Hrithik Roshan, the movie is is an action thriller one where Yami plays the role of a blind girl but proudly working and independent. She gets married to Hrithik but some goons in his absence end up gang-raping her not once but twice and she ends up committing suicide. The plot line is emotional and really makes you question about who defines justice.6. UriscreengrabUri was again one of those films that changed her career graph for better. Like all her previous films, this one too ranks among the highest grosser films. The movie is a dramatised version of the true events of the retaliation to the 2016 Uri attack where Yami plays the role of an intelligence officer It was an interesting approach for me as an actor. There should be no trying too hard to project yourself in a certain way, in terms of your expressions or dialogue delivery. You have to be natural, she said in an interview earlier.7. BalaYami Gautam/FCShe plays the role of an Tik Tok influencer who falls in love with a bald guy which she finds out after her wedding. Whether it is Yami's comic timing, overdressing or mere shock at knowing about her husband's bald look. she nails her character to perfection. Her second movie with Ayushmann and it turned out to be a hit again.8 Gini Weds SunnyTwitterShe was last seen on OTT platform Netflix in a film opposite Vikrant Massey. And no this again wasn't the girl next door character you would think she would take up. Infact, a rebel, independent, adventurous are some of the things totally defining her role. Thank you Yami for showing us Bollywood is no longer about running around trees for pretty girls! Here's to new beginnings personally and professionally!9. Her Fairness cream journey has been more controversial, less commercialscreengrabMany actors have slammed Bollywood celebrities for featuring in campaigns on fairness creams. But Yami says she will not choose her endorsements on the basis of someone elses ideology. When we talk about individuality and choice, its my life, my decisions why question my credibility? I am a self-made girl. I will not run my career on somebody elses decision or ideology. I have my own mind, Yami said in an interview. The brand has the right to advertise a product but you cannot show that not being fair is an upsetting thing. You can advertise your brand, but showing not being fair is something to be upset and sad about is not correct, she said."

I have a laptop given by the institute, but lack of internet connectivity, electricity and space issues have affected my studies,"" he said. Over the last year, Kolurwar has shifted between four villages in search of good network connectivity.Having studied in Marathi-medium government schools in their village, some students have also faced language barriers that are further triggered by the digital divide.Akshata Jambhore (23) from Pathrad village expressed her unhappiness about attending courses online and not being able to visit the campus. It was already difficult for me to understand English lectures, and now I have to deal with digital learning. Most of my classmates stay in the city, and it's hard to communicate with them and with my professors to clear my doubts. I am trying my best to bridge the gap between us by having group interactions, she added.Prakash Kolurwar studying on his farm (Picture courtesy of Anagha Sawant - 101Reporters)23-year-old Abhijeet Pazare, a resident of Ramwakdi village and a student at TISS, Hyderabad, had similar feelings. ""I haven't even visited my college campus. All lectures and exams are being held online. Since a mobile tower was set up in my village a year ago, I don't have network issues. I have completed a course in MSCIT [The Maharashtra State Certificate in Information Technology], so I have computer knowledge, but English is still a barrier for me.""Many students from rural Yavatmal cannot afford the fees for their higher education. So the students have either opted for education loans, received scholarships or borrowed money from their relatives to complete their studies. In several cases, educational institutes have also been able to provide the necessary resources.""It was tough to prepare for exams. Opening reference materials, jotting down class notes, attending lectures, accessing everything on a small mobile screen became annoying. Luckily, in the fourth semester, the college managed to provide us with a laptop and Rs 1,500 for internet recharge,"" added Gaikwad.Residing in Yavatmal's Baggi village, Savita Vadde (23) is pursuing her MA in Social Innovation Entrepreneurship from TISS, Tuljapur. Her phone didn't have a 4G technology upgrade, and there was a problem installing the Zoom app.""I had to purchase a new phone to attend lectures. I didn't have enough money, so a friend helped me financially, and I paid her in instalments. However, due to the lack of tech devices initially, I missed out on attending a few lectures and submitting projects, and my scores decreased,"" she said. Later, Vadde emailed her institute about her financial problems, and they provided her with a laptop.Eklavya, a Yavatmal based organisation that works with first-generation learners, has also been trying to crowd-source laptops for students who want to attend lectures from remote areas and appear for various entrance exams.The organisation Eklavya brings together students in the rural parts of Yavatmal to help them prepare for entrance exams (Picture courtesy of Anagha Sawant - 101Reporters)""Most first-generation learners are willing to migrate to different cities to complete their education. We recently had a difficult time arranging for laptops because the number of students who wanted to appear for the entrance exam was high. So we had to borrow laptops from other students and working professionals in the districts,"" Raju Kendre, the founder of Eklavya, said.The governments push for digitisation must be comprehensive and must take into account the various barriers in education amongst rural communities. As the Lancet report recommends, 'Right To Technology' needs to be part of 'Right To Education'. However, until that plays out, these students will continue overcoming challenges to receive a good education that can lift them up from their circumstances."

Be it his dance project or his acting stint, he always gave his best. I still remember how he used to rehearse for his performances till 2 am at night. Everyone used to leave but he would keep rehearsing. In the mornings, he had Pavitra Rishta shoot and after pack up he would come to the studio for his dance rehearsal. It must be so exhausting for him but he never complained. There was even a time when he performed despite suffering from severe back pain. In fact, he always asked me to give him difficult steps... he believed in challenging himself and doing things out of his comfort zone,"" she told Cinema Journal.""Today, when I revisit our last chats of 2020 on Whatsapp, I can see messages that read  Sir aapko bohot miss kar raha hoon (I miss you a lot) and I would tell him to have patience till the lockdown gets lifted. We used to meet a lot. He would always say, Aapke saath baat karta hoon toh bohot positive energy milti hai (I feel positive while talking to you),'"" he told TOI."

542586," For those of us following Euro 2020, Christian Eriksen collapsing on the pitch in the game between Denmark and Finland was a scary sight. He had to be taken to hospital and play was suspended for some time before resuming once the news came that he was stable.The incident saw solidarity from fans and players for Eriksen, but the real heroes were the on-field medical staff, which saved his life with the skills that they used in the emergency situation. By the doctor's own admission, his pulse had stopped and he needed to be revived. They performed CPR and that saved his life.When it comes to Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), we have heard that term several times in our lives. We know that it is important and can save lives before the medical help reaches the person who is sinking.AFPWe might have all seen it at least once on one of those health programs on TV, which always remind us how to help a person suffering from a cardiac problem. But more often than not, most of us would have ignored it. After witnessing what happened to Christian Eriksen last night, many of us would like to learn the skills that can save critical time and help the patient get his/her breathing back.iStockHere's how we can practice CPR and use it in case someone requires it.1. Position your hand. Make sure the patient is lying on his back on a firm surface.2. Interlock fingers.CDC3. Give chest compressions.4. Open the airway.5. Give rescue breaths.6. Watch chest fall.7. Repeat chest compressions and rescue breaths.AFP1. High-Frequency Chest Compressions. This technique involves imitating hear beats by giving more chest compressions at intervals of time in high frequency.2. Open-Chest CPR. Open chest CPR is a procedure in which the heart is retrieved through thoracotomy.3. Interposed Abdominal Compression CPROf course, now whether or not and how much CPR should be used varies from person to person. Younger people respond better while the elderly tend not to.Knowing CPR can come in handy even if you are not a medical professional in tough situations. In fact, science shows that it has saved several lives and kept them stable until medical help has arrived.So, knowing it is a boon and the next time you see someone's pulse stop, you can look to revive them until health gets there."

542538," Opener Rohit Sharma countering Trent Boult's incoming deliveries will make for a fascinating contest, something that Virender Sehwag will be looking forward to during the World Test Championship final between India and New Zealand, starting in Southampton on June 18.Sehwag, who redefined the art of opening batting in Test cricket, feels that Rohit's qualities and recent form at the top of the order certainly makes him a candidate to succeed during the six Test matches in England this summer.AFP""No doubt Trent Boult-Tim Southee combination will pose a lot of challenge for Indians. They can move the ball both ways and are brilliant while bowling in partnerships also,"" Sehwag told PTI during an interview.""Boult vs Rohit Sharma will be a contest that I would be looking forward to. If Rohit gets set and sees off Boult's opening spell, it will be a treat to watch,"" feels one of India's greatest match winners in the longer format.While this would be Rohit's first shot at opening in English conditions, the experience of playing Tests in 2014 will certainly help him.ICC""Rohit is a fantastic batsman and he has played Test cricket in England earlier also (2014) so I think he can manage well as we have seen in recent times when he has opened the batting. I have no doubt that he will score runs in England this time.""Obviously, as it is for any opener, he would have to be careful for the first 10 overs and see off that new ball to understand the conditions first. I am sure he will get a chance to show his range of strokes,"" said the man, who has scored more than 8000 Test runs.If there is one player apart from Rohit, who can be as maverick as Sehwag was during his glory days, it is Rishabh Pant, who is going through a purple patch in his international career.Sehwag wants Pant to bat the way he knows and not get bogged down by too much analysis and dissection about technique and temperament needed to be successful in England.Twitter""Rishabh Pant knows his batting better than anybody else and he should focus on what he can do best for the team rather than get worried about what ex-cricketers, commentators and media is saying,"" Sehwag said about the keeper, who has already scored a hundred in English conditions during the tour of 2018.""The focus for Rishabh should be one ball at a time. If the ball is there to be hit, he should hit it. I don't think he needs to change approach as he has got success with the same approach and Test matches are different ball game.""Of late, he has understood his role in the team and he is a very critical player for India in Test matches coming in at No 6. If he gets set and starts scoring runs, he can change the game in a session and we have all seen that.""Once and for all, Sehwag also wants to put to rest the debate around Cheteshwar Pujara's ""strike-rate"" and ""intent"".""In Test cricket, I don't think strike-rate has ever mattered. When I played Test cricket for India, after me there was Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman coming into bat. All of whom played with a Test strike rate of 50s mostly which was perfectly fine,"" Sehwag said."

The Gram Panchayat around 30km from Jabalpur town issued a diktat that those not vaccinated wont be offered ration.AFPNot only this, locals were told by the rural body that for availing benefit of any government scheme, one has to get vaccine jabs. This fuelled a kind of frenzy among locals as in no time the village of around 1,200 achieved 85% vaccination.Similarly, in Karnataka, in a bid to counter vaccine hesitancy and to prod residents residents to get inoculated against Covid-19 on priority, Gadak gram panchayat has passed a no vaccine no ration resolution.APOfficials of the Kotabal gram panchayat said they are aware that PDS supplies cannot be stopped on such grounds and that it is merely a slogan to motivate villagers."

I got married in 2019 and moved 15 minutes away from them, so needless to say, I met them every alternate day. So, those 3 months were the longest I had gone without seeing daddy dearest. Having lived all my life with him, this was the hardest thing to do. For three months, we exchanged hugs and kisses on FaceTime and I yearned to meet him every single day. I learnt the importance of his presence and this Fathers Day, I am simply grateful to have him around!GiphyMy fondest memory with dad is cooking with him. Every Saturday night, wed make Rajma Chawal together. We can call it a Saturday staple at the Kumar residence. After that, wed listen to Jagjit Singh in silence munching on our favourite snacks. Hed kiss me goodnight and go to bed after that. Nothing too fancy but still something that I miss every day.If cooking was our bonding exercise, should I give him fancy silverware? Nah!As I said, it was a Saturday ritual and never really happened any day before or after that. Hes not a chef, hes a dad who loves spending time with his daughter and does it by making Rajma Chawal with her.

Because I had him.So, this Father's Day, I am going to give him the gift of time and togetherness, for just reliving our childhood memories of no worries. And to make one such memory come true, I picked up these gorgeous bowls that we can eat Rajma Chawal in.And if you listen to him, the key to making something super delicious is cooking it in desi bartan as he calls it. So, I think Ill add this traditional handi to my cart too.GiphyWith my mom testing positive during this second wave, it was dad who held everything together. Even though he was shaking with hopelessness every day, he put a brave face in front of me and mom, every single day until she recovered. Were all grateful that she did.To us, no gift in this world would be bigger than having each other. Being together in the kitchen making Rajma Chawal seems like one of the most fun things to do these days.So, this Fathers Day, I am going to meet him, make Rajma Chawal, and relive the old Jagjit Singh days.

542483," People around the world are getting vaccinated against the novel coronavirus. And with the vaccines, theyre also coming across common side effects like fever, body ache, weakness etc.However, this one individual from Nashik, Maharashtra claims to have experienced a unique new side effect -- magnetism.TOI/NBTAlso Read: Scientists Discover Dead Cockroaches Make Excellent Magnets Than Alive Ones!As reported first by Navbharat Times (highlighted by TOI), the senior citizen, who goes by the name of Arvind Sonar, a resident of Shivaji Chowk of Nashik claims that metal objects have been sticking to his body easily after getting vaccinated.In a video, he is also seen showing spoons, coins etc sticking to his body. You guys might be wondering if it would be because of sweat. Even Sonars family members thought it's because of sweat, however, metal objects continued to stick even when his skin was completely dry.Dr Ashok Thorat, in a conversation with TOI said, ""I have seen the video, however, we can't confirm that it has happened after vaccination. After investigation only we can come to some conclusion. For now, we will send a report to the government and after that, we will see if any investigation needs to be done.""While you might be wondering if this odd occurrence is only seen in India, youll be surprised to know that people in the US have reported something similar.According to a report by NYMag, while participating in a hearing that would weaken the Ohio states vaccination laws, anti-vaccine Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, an osteopathic physician, as an expert witness stood against the health committee, speaking about the side effects of vaccines and one particular one about people getting magnetised after the second dose of the vaccine.While defending Tenpennys point, a woman who called herself a registered nurse, while trying to stick a key on her face, neck and forehead stated, Explain to me why the key sticks to me. It sticks to my neck too. Although funnily, the key kept falling off her neck.Wow. An anti-vaccine nurse in Ohio tried to prove the Vaccines Cause Magnetism theory in an state legislative committee. The demonstration did not go to plan we all want to believe this so badly (seriously, who wouldnt want to become Magneto), and this could even be a crazy cool incentive to get more people to get vaccinated, sadly, according to a Reuters fact check, vaccines dont really make us magnetic.Also Read: Common Myths On COVID-19 Treatments Debunked By Doctor On TwitterReuters fact check report states that none of the COVID-19 jabs approved for use in the US and UK contain any metallic ingredients, linking back to info from Pfizer, FDA and the Gov.uk. The report states that some jabs do have the presence of aluminium, in very small quantities, but theyre as much as youd consume through natural food or even water.ReutersAlso Read: US Anti-Vaxxers Are Wearing Masks To Protect Them From Vaccinated PeopleThe report reveals that even if these vaccines did contain metals, they wouldnt really cause a magnetic reaction. According to the medical professionals at the Meedan Health Desk, The amount of metal that would need to be in a vaccine for it to attract a magnet is much more substantial than the amounts that could be present in a vaccine's small dose.They also highlighted that humans are naturally a little magnetic due to the presence of iron in our body. However, our body is also mostly water, and iron and water together repel magnets slightly -- thats actually how MRI machines can look into our bodies.Another expert, Professor Michael Coey from the School of Physics at Trinity College Dublin also called these concerns nonsensical, stating that one would need at least a gram of iron metal to attract and stick to a permanent magnet, and if something that substantial was injected youd actually feel it.Moreover, he added that both he and his wife got vaccinated with both doses of Pfizer vaccines and none of them have magnets attracting their arms."
542482," Pakistan's National Assembly has approved a bill allowing Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav to appeal his conviction in the high courts of the country. The bill seeks to provide further right of review and reconsideration in giving effect to the judgment of the International Court of Justice.The bill was adopted by the National Assembly on Thursday after approval from the 21-member standing committee. It has been named 'International Court of Justice (Review and Re-consideration) Act.FileThe Pakistan government had brought an ordinance in the National Assembly earlier in view of the ICJ's ruling in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case. The Act will extend to the whole of Pakistan and shall ""come into force at once"".According to the bill, the High Court has the power to review and reconsider where the ICJ in relation to a foreign national passes an order in respect of rights under the Vienna Convention of Consular Relations or a foreign national is aggrieved in respect of the rights available under the same.FileSuch a foreign national, either himself, through his authorised representative or through a consular officer of a mission of his country, may file a petition before a High Court for review and reconsideration, in terms of Section 3, in regard to an order of conviction or sentence of a Military Court operating under the Pakistan Army, 1952.Earlier this year, a larger bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had resumed hearing of the case related to Jadhav and four other Indian prisoners who were under detention even after completion of their respective sentences.FileIn January, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had slammed Pakistan for not acting upon the ICJ's 2019 judgment that had upheld India's claim of the Pakistani regime committing the grievous violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations on several counts regarding Jadhav. India has also lashed out at Pakistan for failing to provide consular access to Jadhav.Jadhav, a retired Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court in April 2017. Pakistan claims that Jadhav was arrested from Balochistan in 2016 on charges of espionage. India has rejected Pakistan's allegations and said he was kidnapped from the Iranian port of Chabahar."

542475," The Family Man is undoubtedly one of the best series and every actor deserves all the appreciation for their hard work. One artist who has been longing for this kind of appreciation and recognition since long is Sharib Hashmi - the man who won hearts by playing JK in the show.TwitterThe man has been struggling for 12 years to get this kind of recognition and finally his hard work has paid off.To begin with, we asked Sharib if he expected that The Family Man will become this big for him, to which he said,When season one of Family Man was out, I had a lot of expectations from it because I really enjoyed working on it. The script was tight, engaging and entertaining. We knew it was a clear winner and we received a lot of love. And now when this second season arrived, we expected same kind of love, but this is the first time that season 2 is loved even more as compared to the first one. I am just overwhelmed with this amazing response. I cant describe how beautiful I am feeling. I have really worked very hard to get this recognition and appreciation.TwitterThe actor who is on cloud nine, thanks to the success of Family Man 2 spoke about his journey which of course was not easy, he said,""The journey has been a roller coaster ride. I have seen a lot of ups and downs. Well, I have seen more downs than ups. But I knew one thing that despite being successful or not, I wanted to become an actor. I wanted to make acting my bread and butter.Slowly and steadily people started recognising my work. But I was damn sure I wanted to do this. I left my job and I had to do this. Also, your success doesnt determine how talented you are. The journey definitely was not easy.""TwitterHe added, You lose hope when you are rejected every day, and its very difficult to keep a positive approach when you face rejection, it takes a lot of courage to keep a positive approach. There are many who lost hope, and gave up saying I dont want to do this. But i kept my patience, and maybe that is why I am now getting the fruit of my hard work.In 2008, I decided to quit my job and make my career in acting. I was 33 years old, married had kids, in that age people get settled, and I took the risk to start from scratch and here I am. There have been many times when I was broken, even I am human. I survived those difficult times only because of my wife and my friends. They not only supported me emotionally but financially.TwitterWhen asked if OTT has given him what he has been longing for, he affirmed and said,Definitely the OTT boom has been very beneficial for all of us. My career got revived because of OTT. Everyone on OTT gets to show their potential and I am one of them.We asked Sharib whats one advice he wants to give aspiring actors who arent confident about their looks, he said,""Look really doesnt matter. I started my acting career so late because even I had a complex that I will not be able to do anything, and that is why I didnt even try and I wasted 10 years of my life. I really hope aspiring actors let go of that complex and start working on it. Dont ever think about your looks, skin or body, if you feel you can make it, just go for it.TwitterBefore Family Man 2, Sharib was known for his movie Filmistaan. We asked him if ever feared the label of one film wonder, to which he said,""Even if I would have been known for one film and if that was only Filmistaan, I would died peacefully. That was a beautiful film and I played a lead. That film got all the appreciation and recognition including National Award. And if only I would have known for that film I would be thankful because there are many who havent even reached there. I have got a lot in life and that may not be materialistic but I am content.Indeed, this mans story is every bit inspiring. Shine on!"
542473," In a minor setback to Bharat Biotech, the maker of the first indigenous COVID-19 vaccines, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) denied emergency use authorization for Covaxin in the country.The FDA has also asked Ocugen, the US partner of Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech for additional data on the vaccine after it applied EUA.BCCLAccording to Bharat Biotech, the FDA has recommended Ocugen to ""pursue a Biologics Licence Application (BLA) submission instead of an EUA application"".This means that Ocugen will have to apply for full approval, with additional data.""Ocugen Inc today announced that upon recommendation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it will pursue submission of a biologics license application (BLA) for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, COVAXIN. The Company will no longer pursue an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for COVAXIN,"" a statement by the Bharat Biotech said.BCCL""Ocugen is in discussions with the FDA to understand the additional information required to support a BLA submission. The Company anticipates that data from an additional clinical trial will be required to support the submission,"" the statement added.According to the Hyderabad-based company, with good herd immunity and a significant percentage of the population vaccinated, the pandemic is reducing in the US. ""On the sidelines of this, the USFDA had earlier communicated that no new emergency use authorisation (EUA) would be approved for new Covid-19 vaccines.""BCCLNo vaccine manufactured or developed from India has ever received EUA or full licensure from USFDA, it said. ""When approved, it will be a great leap forward for vaccines innovation and manufacturing from India,"" it added.Though the company is confident about a BLA approval for Covaxin, the denial of EUA is a setback for US ambitions of the Indian biotechnology as the US rollout of the vaccine has to be delayed now.Covaxin has already received emergency approval in 14 other countries and many more are in the process.One of the biggest problems Bharat Biotech has faced is the lack of data from Phase-3 clinical trials.ReutersOn Thursday, Bharat Biotech had said that the results of third phase trials of Covaxin are expected to be released next month.Bharat Biotech said its service provider, IQVIA, has started the final statistical analysis.Raches Ella, who leads the Covid-19 projects at Bharat Biotech, said that after submitting efficacy and 2-months of safety to Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) in July, it is expected to instantly reach the pre-print server. Peer review will take another 2-4 months.BCCLAccording to him, the phase 3 trials of Covaxin was the largest efficacy trial conducted in the developing world with a sample size of 25,800.The lack of EUA by the WHO has put many in India who have taken Covaxin at a spot as many countries that mandate a vaccination completion certificate for travel clearance do not recognize the Indian vaccine."

The tale of Ranjit Singh Raj from the dusty lanes of Jaipur to a life in Geneva, is one such unique anecdote.Resilience, grit, and hard work, Raj's life has been all that and more. Belonging to an underprivileged family, he had a tough childhood. While his family sent him to school to 'become something', he had little interest in school.NRIaffairsI am 10th-fail. I wasnt good at my studies, but my folks sent me to school to become something. No one cared about creativity and imagination. I had zero ambition. Raj told NRIaffairs.At the age of 16, he started driving an autorickshaw, a job which he did for several years in Jaipur.What Raj didnt know was the hidden entrepreneurship in him. He says he noticed that other auto drivers spoke English, French, Spanish and other foreign languages to attract tourists.I was very impressed., he remembers. That was in 2008. Many young people were then doing IT, but I just wanted to learn English.It prompted him to set up a tourism business and he started taking foreign tourists around Rajasthan. As fate would have it, It was then that he met his future wife, and his life took a turn for good.NRIaffairsRaj's wife was his client. She had come to travel around India. Raj was her travel guide and showed her around Jaipur. As close as it can come to a Bollywood film, they soon fell in love.We first met at the City Palace. She had come with one of her girlfriends to travel around India. We started liking each other and got talking. After she returned to France, we stayed connected via Skype. We realised we were in love,"" he told NRIaffairs.Raj made several attempts to go to France to meet her, but his visa application got rejected. They became impatient after multiple rejections.He remembers, We wondered how, after multiple visa rejections, we would be able to sustain our long-distance relationship. So on her next visit to India, we both sat in front of the French Embassy, in protest, demanding to meet the French Ambassador to India. An embassy official soon met us. They were initially sceptical about giving me a visa but finally granted me a three-month tourist visa to go to France. I made multiple trips after that and kept coming to France.NRIaffairsIn 2014 they got married and later had a child. Raj then applied for a long term visa with the French Embassy.I was asked to learn French. I took French classes at The Alliance France in New Delhi and got a certificate. That helped me get a long term visa.Raj now lives in Geneva, where he works at a restaurant. Recently, he started a YouTube channel to teach how to cook.He also dreams of starting his own restaurant and is working hard to make that happen.What an incredible story!Also read: Unemployed Indian-Origin Man Who Lost Job Due To COVID-19 Wins $1 Million In Raffle"

542467," Researchers from Cambridge University have found a way to create a vegan substitute to spider silk, thats biodegradable and could replace single-use plastics in the near future.XamplaAlso Read: Japan Plastic Waste: Government Orders 100% Plastic Recycle, Reuse & CollectionInspired by spider silk thats known to be the strongest materials known to nature, the human-made vegan version is actually not very different from plastic, however, instead of taking years to decompose, it could disappear in weeks.The material was developed using a new approach for assembling plant proteins into materials that mimic silk on a molecular level. Spider webs are strong, despite the hydrogen bonds that hold the silk together is actually 100 to1000 times weaker than the powerful glue of steels metallic bonds.Researchers found that one of the key features that gives spider silk its strength is these hydrogen bonds, however, they are arranged with a very high density. They saw this and decided to replicate this in other proteins too.They replicated the structures found on spider silk using a soy protein isolate -- a byproduct of soybean oil production thats readily available.Professor Tuomas Knowles at Cambridge explains, Because all proteins are made of polypeptide chains, under the right conditions we can cause plant proteins to self-assemble just like spider silk.Knowles further explained that a spider, the silk protein, is dissolved in an aqueous solution, which results in an immensely strong fibre with the help of a spinning process. However, plant proteins dont mix that well in water, making the assembly more challenging.Also Read: COVID-19 Is Causing Rise In Plastic Waste That Will Harm Environment, Warns ExpertTo circumvent this, they used a mixture of acetic acid and water, along with ultrasonication and high temperatures that bettered the solubility of the soy protein isolate. It also helps in making protein structures possess ultra-strong hydrogen bond formation.The material has been proven to be similar in performance to engineering plastics like low-density polyethene -- the most used variant of plastic in the world.The new vegan spider-silk plastic will be commercialised by Xampla, a University of Cambridge spin-out company and theyre already testing different applications of it, such as single-use sachets, food packaging etc.Mattel, the company behind iconic toy brands like Hotwheels and of course, Barbie has announced that for the first time ever, theyre going to launch a series of eco-friendly doll collections that have been made from 90 percent of recycled ocean-bound recycled plastic.MattelAlso Read: Scientist Nalini Nadkarni Has Inspired Her Own Barbie, And We Should All Be Proud Of HerThe plastic is sourced within 50 kilometres of waterways in areas lacking formal waste collection systems.

542465," Soma, a rural city 240 kilometres (150 miles) north of Tokyo that was devastated by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, has surged ahead of most of the country in vaccinations by heeding lessons learned from the catastrophe of a decade ago.That disaster taught Soma the importance of laying out and communicating clear plans, working closely with local medical professionals, gathering affected people in concentrated places - and not waiting for a plan to come down from Tokyo, said Vice Mayor Katsuhiro Abe.Reuters""I don't know if you would say that we couldn't have done this had it not been for the earthquake disaster,"" Abe said. ""But this inoculation programme comes in conjunction with the experience of the city government and the people coming together to deal with that for these 10 years.""Tamio Hayashi, 77, doubted he could ever navigate the internet systems set up to register for COVID-19 vaccines across most of Japan. He hated the idea of using the ""troublesome"" systems that have broken down and befuddled other older residents, hobbling Japan's inoculation push.Luckily, local officials in his small, northeastern town helped him through the red tape and he got his shots - a rarity in Japan, where the authorities are racing to inoculate the vulnerable elderly population before the start of the Summer Olympics in just six weeks.Reuters""This way is great,"" Hayashi told Reuters after he and his wife got their second doses at a local gymnasium. ""You just get a notice that says come on such-and-such a day.""Japan lags far behind other advanced economies in vaccinating its people - 12% have received at least one shot, according to a Reuters tracker, compared to France, the next lowest in the Group of Seven industrial powers at 42%, and the most advanced, Canada, at 63%.However, Soma's nimble, homegrown approach eschews the reservation systems and fragmented efforts common across Japan. The city that has inoculated 84% of its elderly - versus about 28% nationwide - is now injecting younger generations and aims to reach people as young as 16 by the end of July, just as the Olympics are getting underway.FileBut the city is also succeeding where much of Japan has not because of the painful lessons of the tsunami that killed 450 of the city's people as it swept 4 kilometres (2.5 miles) inland.Part of Soma's success is due to its small population of 35,000, making it easier to reach people in the city on the Pacific coast in Fukushima prefecture than for stretched medical staff in the giant urban areas.APSoma's leaders and doctors, drawing on 2011 lessons, began drafting plans and running inoculation drills in December, months before vaccines were approved. The city set up a central vaccination centre, conserving medical manpower. Residents were called by city block, no reservation necessary, and the city sent busses for those who could not travel on their own.After the previous disaster, Soma's neighbours know to look out for each other, while city officials are used to shifting gears from office work to crisis management, said Abe, a lifelong Soma resident. Townspeople are shuttled briskly to waiting areas and screenings, then to a partitioned area for their shots.AFPWhen some older patients got flustered being asked to turn left or right for their shots, staff improvised with cartoon posters on the walls: face the bunny for an injection in your right arm, turn to the doggy to get it in the left arm.""The strategy needs to be tailored to each local culture and context,"" said Kenji Shibuya, who this spring resigned as director of the Institute for Population Health at King's College London to help run Soma's COVID-19 vaccination push. ""It's a war,"" said Shibuya, a persistent critic of Japan's handling of the pandemic."

Will you be able to erase the emotional scar from your life?Based on this concept and roughly inspired by an incident that took place in his childhood, director Ashish Pant's debut film starring Saloni Batra and Vikas Kumar is a story of a married couple who injure a pedestrian in a car accident. How they deal with it and its practical and emotional implications is what the film highlights.YouTubeTwitterSIFF press catalogue describes the film as, ""A middle-class couple drove and knocked down someone. The two had completely different attitudes towards the accident, which caused an unbridgeable crack in their relationship. The film uses a realistic style to discuss issues such as class contradictions and materialism in contemporary Indian society, and question whether the middle class can help promote social progress. Director Pant repeatedly uses Ozu's ""cross-axis"" dialogue and scheduling in the film, so that the subjective point of view of the character coincides with the point of view of the audience, so as to ask the audience's soul. Although the film is Pant's feature film debut, it is particularly sophisticated in its handling of characters and social themes.""townnews.com""On behalf of the entire team that made The Knot I feel humbled and honoured to have our Asian premiere at Shanghai International Film Festival. I really hope that The Knot's universal themes resonate with the audience at SIFF. I'd like to thank the selectors at SIFF and Kyoko Dan for giving The Knot this platform to reach audiences in China,"" director Pant was quoted as saying by IANS.""I am happy that Uljhan has found itself at such a prestigious platform. It is a matter of great honour for Ashish to be a part of an official selection in the SIFF Gala section at the Shanghai International Film Festival. We are very grateful to the selection committee of the festival to show us their love and appreciation. The cast and crew of the film are very excited to bring the film to Chinese audiences. Sadly, the pandemic has kept us from travelling to the festival, the opportunity is sourly missed,"" added producer Kartikeya Narayan Singh.SIFF will be held from June 11 to June 20"
542436," Bank customers will have to pay 21 per transaction, instead of 20, with effect from January 1, 2022, if they exceed the monthly limit of free transactions. This comes after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday permitted lenders to increase charges for cash and non-cash automated teller machine (ATM) transactions beyond free monthly permissible limit from next year.Reuters / Representational ImageThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) okayed a hike in the interchange fees per transaction through ATMs from the existing 15 to 17 for financial transactions. For non-financial transactions, the fees has been increased from five rupees to six rupees.The revised charges are in order to compensate banks who will have to shell out more as interchange fee from August 1. Therefore, the increased fees will be applicable from August 1, 2021 onwards.RBI also took into account the increasing cost of ATM deployment and expenses towards ATM maintenance incurred by banks and white label ATM operators, a statement issued by the central bank said.PTIBank customers are allowed five free transactions per month, if they use their own bank ATMs. When customers who use other bank ATMs to do transactions, metro customers are allowed three free transactions per month and non-metro customers are allowed five.In June 2019, a committee headed by the chief executive officer of Indian Banks Association had made recommendations on ATM charges and the entire gamut of fees attached to transactions conducted on them. The committee at the time had recommended a charge of Rs 24 per transaction to customers.PTIAn interchange fees is the amount which the card issuing bank pays to the ATM operator if a transaction by a customer has been made from an ATM which does not belong to the card-issuing bank.This will incentivise banks, managed service providers and white label ATM operators to significantly increase ATM penetration in semi urban and rural areas thereby boosting the financial inclusion agenda of the RBI and Govt of India,a spokesperson for Confederation of ATM Industry said."

The universe is conspiring to do just that -- to let our spirits soar beyond all the sombreness and suffering, even if for the briefest of moments.AFPTwo continents  Europe and South America  are about to begin two of worlds biggest football competitions. The fans are eagerly awaiting to spend some hours with their families and friends supporting their teams, pausing all pandemic-ridden thoughts.ALSO READ: Why France Could Actually Win Euro 2020The Euros were planned for summer of 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic quickly made it impossible, and UEFA shifted the Euro Championships to 2021. Most of the European countries, particularly England, Italy, France and Germany have mostly recovered from the two deadly pandemic waves. Now, Europe seems ready to open the gates of the stadiums for the public to come and watch their heroes play. What a sight it will be, at long last!AFPThis time, the Euro 2020 matches will be held across Europe between June 11 and July 11. This is happening for the first time in the 60 year history of the tournament. Several cities of Europe have prepared themselves to host the biggest football event in the continent. Although, matches of the UEFA Champions League are played across Europe, the passion for the European title with the national team will be entirely different.Cities like London, Rome, Munich and others saw a lot of COVID-19 cases. However, they have recovered well and appear fully prepared to leave the past behind and look to host the matches with full energy. People, too, seem ready to throng the streets, singing the songs and praising their teams. A glimpse of this was seen during the recently held UEFA Champions League final at Estadio Do Dragao in Porto. The match was between the two English teams Manchester City and Chelsea. The event saw a lot of people travelling from England to Portugal.Meanwhile, in South America, Argentina and Colombia were getting ready to host 10 nations for the Copa America event. This, too, would have made history, as for the first time in 105 years, the tournament would have two joint hosts. But social and economic unrest caused by anti-government protests made it difficult for Colombia to host the tournament, according to reports.AFPIn Argentina, COVID-19 spoilt the party. Rising number of Covid cases forced the authorities to think about shifting the tournament away from Argentina. Though CONMEBOL did not disclose the exact reason, it said present circumstances compelled them to arrive at the decision.Copa America will finally be held in four Brazilian cities this time  Rio de Janeiro, Brasilia, Goiania and Cuiaba. The opening match will be played between original hosts Argentina and Chile on June 13, while the defending champions Brazil will play against Venezuela a day later.Brazil was one of the worst pandemic-hit countries in the world. It was right on top along with US and India in terms of number of deaths and daily fresh cases. Although theres huge criticism of Brazil over hosting the sporting event at such a critical time, the authorities are confident that they are prepared with their safety plans.Euro 2020 will see 24 teams competing for the title. The teams, which have qualified this time include:Group A: Turkey, Italy, Wales, SwitzerlandGroup B: Denmark, Finland, Belgium, RussiaGroup C: Netherlands, Ukraine, Austria, North MacedoniaGroup D: England, Croatia, Scotland, Czech RepublicGroup E: Spain, Sweden, Poland, SlovakiaGroup F: Hungary, Portugal, France, GermanyMeanwhile, in Copa America, for the first time since 1993, the Copa Amrica will not feature two guest nations after CONMEBOL announced it will host this summer's tournament with only the 10 South American nations  Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay and Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. Australia and Qatar were slated to participate, but both national teams were forced to withdraw due to World Cup qualifying in Asia this summer.According to Euro 2020 organisers, safety protocols relating to the pandemic differ between host nations, and while local health regulations provide the primary reference point for ensuring supporter safety at each stadium, including attendance limits, they are supplemented by UEFA's own minimum criteria. This means that match organisers at all UEFA matches are committed to adopting best practices based on medical advice to minimise the risk of infection.AFPThe organisers have asked the hosts to ensure that practices including, general hygiene measures, ticketing and seating, temperature measurement, queue management and food stalls, etc., should be conducted with utmost care to ensure that the pandemic stays away from the venues.If all goes well, these sports tournaments will mark a new beginning for the post-Covid mega events. A lot of lessons will be learnt from these events about how to conduct the upcoming sporting events which include, the Wimbledon and ICC World Test Championship final in England, the all-important Olympics in Tokyo, ICC T20 World Cup in India, and in 2022 the first ever FIFA World Cup in the Gulf.AFPIt is true that the pandemic is far from over. Experts are constantly warning about future COVID-19 waves with possibly more lethal mutants. However, a history of human civilisation teaches us that humans have been the ultimate survivors on the planet. If theres anything thats going to help us is a positive attitude towards life, lots of discipline in healthcare and an effort to keep entertaining ourselves. What could be better than football for that, the beautiful game most followed all around the world? Even if you dont follow players on the field, their stories off the field are worth exploring, especially in these unprecedented times we live in.So lets hope and pray that all of us stay safe, watch and enjoy the upcoming sporting events, get vaccinated and say goodbye to the pandemic."

The new process is essentially a method of double fermentation that allows chocolatiers to process cocoa beans and at the same time add their naturally extracted flavours.The process involves cocoa beans to be fermented using fruit pulp or rind. The double fermentation allows the existing microflora in the pulp or rind to offer natural fruit flavouring to the chocolates. This also results in the presence of natural antioxidant properties from the cocoa beans as well to enhance the overall richness.The research team consisted of Dr Jastin Samuel, who leads waste valorization research, and co-researcher, Dr Evangeline Christina, Professor of Molecular Biology and Genetic Engineering, School of Bioengineering and Biosciences at Lovely Professional University. They were assisted by Radhika Lakhanpal, an alumna of the 2019 batch of Integrated BSc-MSc in Microbiology of Lovely Professional University.Also Read: Indian University Will Offer Free Tuition To COVID-19 Workers And Their ChildrenSamuel said in a statement, The invention emerged from my personal experience.

542412," Researchers from Russias Institute of Physicochemical and Biological Problems have discovered a microscopic arctic animal who has been asleep for 24,000 years in the permafrost of Siberia and has just woken up.Michael PlewkaAlso Read: Climate Change Rising: Arctic Siberia Was Warmer Than Mumbai, Which Is AlarmingThe creature is a bdelloid rotifer, a minuscule freshwater critter that has survived for a millennia in the freezing permafrost of Siberia. Rotifers, also commonly known as wheel animalcules were earlier believed to have survived up to 10 years when frozen. However, the new research has set a new limit.The multicellular invertebrates are actually female and are popular for their resistance to radiation. They are also capable of withstanding inhospitable environments such as starvation, low oxygen and even drying. They are often found in freshwater lakes, ponds, streams and moist terrestrial habitats like tree bark, moss, and soil.These rotifers come equipped with a complete digestive tract that has both a mouth and an anus. Their secret to surviving harsh conditions is by disabling all activity in their body and putting the body in the state of cryptobiosis -- arresting their metabolism.Also Read: Climate Change Saw Siberia Hit 38C, May Be Hottest Temperature In Arctic CircleStas Malavin, one of the lead researchers explains the phenomenon, It's a state, kind of, between life and death. According to Stas, the rotifers would have been under the feet of big woolly creatures. Moreover, they saw that once the ice was thawed, they were also able to reproduce.Michael PlewkaAlso Read: Record-Breaking Heatwave Hits The Arctic, As Russia Saw Its Hottest Winter EverStas added, ""Our report is the hardest proof as of today that multicellular animals could withstand tens of thousands of years in cryptobiosis, the state of almost completely arrested metabolism.""""The takeaway is that a multicellular organism can be frozen and stored as such for thousands of years and then return back to life -- a dream of many fiction writers. Of course, the more complex the organism, the trickier it is to preserve it. For mammals, it's not currently possible."""

Two CAs, a Tibetan woman along with 8 others have been arrested.Around five lakh Indians have been cheated plus their sensitive data stolen through malicious quick earning apps running in the garb of an online multi-level marketing campaign. Over Rs 150 crore was lost by them in just two months, according to police commissioner S Shrivastava.Rs 11 crore of that money has been blocked in various bank accounts and payment gateways and Rs 97 lakh cash recovered from a Gurgaon-based CA who formed over 110 companies for Chinese fraudsters.iStockThese apps offered lucrative returns on investment with claims to double the investment amount in 24-35 days. They also had schemes promising returns on an hourly and daily basis, and had investment options starting from Rs 300 to several lakhs. One of the apps, Power Bank, was recently trending at No 4 on Google Play Store, cops said.Explaining the origin of the operation, DCP Anyesh Roy said the Cyber Crime Cell had taken notice of various posts on social media by people about two apps: Power Bank and EZPlan.A team led by ACP Aditya Gautam carried out extensive technical analysis of apps at a lab. ""EZPlan was available on the website www.ezplan.in. The Power Bank app projected itself as a Bengaluru-based Technology Start-Up involved in quick-charging technology, in a bid to deceive people. However, the server on which the app was hosted was found to be based in China,"" the DCP said.The malicious apps were also associated with several permissions such as access to camera, read contact details and read and write to external storage.In order to entice large number of people to invest more, a small pay out amounting to 5-10% of the invested money was given.iStockPeople, believing the ""scheme"" to be genuine, started investing more money as well as circulating and sharing the apps with their friends and relatives. Once someone had invested a large amount, their account was blocked by the apps, thus causing severe financial loss.When asked how people got to know about these apps, the main Chinese handlers behind this massive scam used to randomly contact people over various apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram and hired interested persons as partners for procuring bogus bank accounts, creating shell companies, circulating and promoting the apps, transferring money, etc.""A large number of such apps have been circulated by the fraudsters, including Power Bank, EZCoin, Sun Factory, Lightening Power Bank, etc. Some of these fraudulent, malicious Apps were also listed on Google Play Store,"" said a senior officer.Cops said that most of these apps were promoted through YouTube channels, Telegram channels and WhatsApp chat links sent through bulk SMSes.

542381," Indian-Americans, who constitute the second-largest immigrant group in the US, regularly encounter discrimination and polarisation, according to a survey released on Wednesday.The most recent Indian American Attitudes Survey (IAAS) has found that one out of two Indian Americans felt discriminated against in the United States in the past year, the final year of Trump's regime. Its mostly over the colour of their skin, followed by gender, religion, country of origin and caste, in that order.The survey done jointly by Johns Hopkins University, University of Pennsylvania and Carnegie, with polling group YouGov, also found that US-born Indian Americans are more likely to complain of discrimination than those born outside, mostly in India.GettyIndian-Americans comprise slightly more than 1 per cent of the total US population-and less than 1 per cent of all registered voters. Indian Americans are the second-largest immigrant group in the United States. There are 4.2 million people of Indian origin residing in the United States, according to 2018 data.""Somewhat surprisingly, Indian-Americans born in the United States are much more likely to report being victims of discrimination than their foreign-born counterparts,"" said the report.The findings of the report are based on a nationally representative online survey of 1,200 Indian-American residents in the US -- the 2020 IAAS -- conducted between September 1 and September 20, 2020, it said in a statement.File""Indian-Americans regularly encounter discrimination. One in two Indian Americans reports being discriminated against in the past one year, with discrimination based on skin colour identified as the most common form of bias,"" it said.But there is no data to show if Indian American felt the same level of discrimination or less pre-Trump. The report said, according to their data, one in two Indian Americans reports being subject to some form of discrimination in the past year.It added that the data suggested that discrimination based on skin colour is the most common form of bias: 30% of respondents report feeling discriminated against due to the colour of their skin.indiatimesThe findings showed that 18% were discriminated against due to their gender or religion and 16% for their country of origin. About 5% were discriminated over caste, which, the authors of the report said, based on the responses, was perpetrated by both Indian Americans and non-Indians, such as South Asians who are familiar with caste and related issues.According to the report, Indian-Americans exhibit very high rates of marriage within their community. While eight out of 10 respondents have a spouse or partner of Indian-origin, US-born Indian-Americans are four times more likely to have a spouse or partner who is of Indian-origin but was born in the United States.The survey found that religion plays a central role in the lives of Indian-Americans but religious practice varies.Lowy InstituteTrump's four years were marked by a significant spike in hate crimes and discriminatory behaviour in the US, including the mainstreaming of white supremacists. The worst of it was against Asian Americans, over the Covid-19 outbreak, which Trump and his supporters had taken to calling the China Virus, Wuhan Virus or Kung Flu."
542378," People can be quite touchy about their cars - after all, it is prized and expensive possession.However, some people do not extend similar regard to other people's personal property and wantonly vandalise what does not belong to them.Case in point: A man named Jason Doolan has warned people about the 'mayo man'. He said that he is being targeted by a middle-aged man after a parking dispute. He added that others in the area too have been affected by his antics.Media ScotlandAccording to reports, Doolan's car was smeared with mayonnaise by the stranger who was allegedly angry with where he had parked his Audi. Doolan said that the man has put dozens of pieces of paper lined with mayonnaise on his bonnet, windows, and roof.A report by Metro.co.uk said that the dispute began as the man did not let Doolan park his car next to a block of residential flats and kebab shop.The man allegedly told Doolan that he was blocking the entrance to a fire station.However, Doolan claimed that his car was not blocking the entrance and added that there was plenty of space for any emergency vehicle to pass.FacebookAfter that alteration, Doolan's car has been regularly smeared with the condiment. According to Doolan, the mayo used by the man is of cheap quality and leaves a foul smell on his car.Jason, is a resident of Troon, UK and wanted to catch the man red-handed. He set up a secret camera  which caught the man slapping paper with mayo onto his silver Audi.He also said that the man was putting sticky notes on his car before he moved to mayonnaise.His argument is that I am blocking the entrance for fire engines but I would never do that, there is plenty of space for any emergency vehicle to get past. It started off with little notes that he would put on my car. Then he would start shouting at me as I got out of my car. At one point the whole family was out, said Doolan.FacebookPassive-aggressive much?"
542377," Even since the mass rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in India began, the wastage of life-saving doses has been a concern.While vaccine wastage has been reported from many states, there are others that have been using the extra dose in the vial to give one more vaccination, making sure that nothing goes to waste.BCCLTwo states, Kerala and West Bengal are setting new benchmarks for the utilization of vaccines. While Kerala reported -6.37 per cent vaccine wastage, West Bengal recorded -5.48 per cent, saving 1.10 lakh and 1.61 lakh doses respectively in May.Kerala government had said that the state has been maintaining a negative wastage - meaning that even the doses that were allocated as 'wastage factor' are being utilized to inoculate people.AFPOne vial or a bottle of the vaccine has enough doses to provide the jabs to 10 people, but the manufacturers add one dose extra as a 'wastage factor'.Usually, this is lost between the ten doses that are taken from the one vial, but in Kerala, the Chief Minister said that they have been able to vaccinate 11 people from one vial.While Kerala and West Bengal have managed negative wastage, Jharkhand remains a concern.BCCLJharkhand reported maximum wastage of 33.95 per cent, according to government data.Chhattisgarh reported 15.79 per cent vaccine wastage while Madhya Pradesh reported 7.35 per cent.States like Punjab, Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra reported 7.08 per cent, 3.95 per cent, 3.91 per cent, 3.78 and 3.63 per cent and 3.59 per cent respectively.AFPThe data showed that a total of 790.6 lakh vaccines were supplied to states and UTs in May out of which total vaccinations were 610.6 lakh while 658.6 lakh shots were utilized and the closing balance was 212.7 lakh.The vaccination in May was less as compared to April in which a total of 898.7 lakh vaccinations were done, 902.2 lakh vaccines were utilised and the closing balance was 80.8 lakh."
542376," Child labour has risen for the first time in 20 years, the United Nations said, with one in 10 children in work worldwide and millions more at risk due to COVID-19.The number of child labourers has increased to 160 million from 152 million in 2016, with the greatest rise in Africa due to population growth, crises and poverty, said the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF).""We are losing ground in the fight against child labour, and the last year has not made that fight any easier,"" UNICEF's executive director Henrietta Fore said in a statement, ahead of the World Day Against Child Labour on June 12.Representational Image""Now, well into a second year of global lockdowns, school closures, economic disruptions, and shrinking national budgets, families are forced to make heart-breaking choices.""The UN has made 2021 the International Year for the Elimination of Child Labour, saying urgent action is needed to meet a goal of ending the practice by 2025.But major gains made since 2000 - when 246 million children were in work - are being reversed and the number could climb back to 206 million by the end of 2022 if governments introduce austerity measures or fail to protect the vulnerable, it said.The UN said that child labourers may now be working longer hours or under worse conditions due to pandemic-related economic shocks and school closures, and many more may be forced into the worst forms of child labour.The report highlighted an increase in the number of children aged between 5 and 11 years in child labour, who now account for just over half of the total global figure, as well as a rise in those in hazardous work that is likely to harm their health or safety.Representational Image""This is what we have been able to measure prior to the pandemic,"" Claudia Cappa, one of the report's authors and senior adviser at UNICEF, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a video call from Geneva.""If we look at the impact of COVID-19, this gives us additional reasons for concern.""Cappa said that the number of child labourers could fall by 15 million with mitigation measures, such as universal child grants, and if free and good quality schooling up until the minimum age for employment was ensured.Increased investment in rural development and decent work in agriculture, a sector that accounts for 70 per cent of child labour, are also key, according to ILO's director-general Guy Ryder.""The new estimates are a wake-up call. We cannot stand by while a new generation of children is put at risk,"" Ryder said.""We are at a pivotal moment and much depends on how we respond. This is a time for renewed commitment and energy, to turn the corner and break the cycle of poverty and child labour."""
542375," Another day and another official has made a bizarre statement about women and crimes against them in the country. A member of the Uttar Pradesh Women's Commission said that girls should not be given mobile phones as it leads to rapes.The irony, it's a statement by a woman who's a part of the commission that fights for women's rights. Meena Kumari made the remarks during a public hearing of complaints related to women in Aligarh district.istock""Girls should not be given mobile phones. Girls talk with boys on phones for hours and later run away with them. Their phones are not even checked and family members are unaware of these things,"" a report in Times of India quoted Meena Kumari as saying.The UP Women's Commission member said the society itself would have to be serious about the increasing crimes against women.In response to a Question abt rising rape cases, Meena Kumari, Member, UP Women Commission said:Girls should not be given mobile phones. They talk on phone & later elope for marriage""So after Chowmein, jeans, now mobile phones r responsible for rape.'s comment was in response to a question about sharp rise in alleged rape cases in the state. Kumari did not stop at this. She also urged the parents especially mothers to monitor their daughters as their careless attitude leads to crimes against women.""Mothers have a big responsibility. Today, if their daughters are careless, then mothers are responsible for that,"" she further said.Meanwhile, the UP Women's Commission has distanced itself from Kumari's statement. Vice President of the Commission, Anju Chaudhary, termed Kumari's statement as wrong saying depriving girls of mobile phones is not a solution to sexual violence against them.""Instead of saying that we should not give mobile phones to girls, we should be teaching them not to chat with strangers and educate them on the safe use of mobile phones,"" the report quoted Chaudhary as saying.FileKumari later tried to cover up her remarks saying that girls from villages don't know ""how to use phones in the right way."" She said girls use phones to befriend men and then run away. She said smartphones are also being used to watch inappropriate content.When Kumari was questioned on how mobile phones are linked to rape, she added saying, ""On a daily basis, I hear complaints of at least 20 women and 5-6 cases are related to friendships on phones and its fallouts. In some cases, girls were lured and then sexually abused."""
542373," Doctors and health workers have been on the frontline ever since India began its battle against the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020.

Pandey, Assistant Professor at the Physical Education Department at CCSU, said: ""This will provide recognition to games that we all loved as children but which are now getting lost. With the new subject, our students and future physical training instructors (PTIs) will be equipped to train school children in such games.""He further said that the games are also meant to build strength.D'Source""One of the games that will be taught in the course is called 'kai danda' which is generally played in west Uttar Pradesh and is known as 'aam dali' in Madhya Pradesh. It prompts children to climb a mango tree while one player chases and catches them. This game not only strengthens muscles in a child but also helps them to concentrate. Marbles also enhance focus while making a child do squats. We hope that the introduction of these games in CCSU will go a long way in their revival and practical application."""
542371," Unlike the first wave, the second wave of COVID-19 was not limited to mostly urban areas and has reached some of the most remote parts of the country.The results of these have been devastating as there are hardly any testing or treatment facilities to take care of the patients.Bhairavi Jani, a Mumbai-based entrepreneur has narrated her story on how she tested positive for COVID-19 in a remote Himalayan village.In a series of tweets, Jani who is currently recovering in a Mumbai hospital said she started showing symptoms while in her little village high in the Himalayas in Munsyari Block of Pithoragarh district which has a population of around 8000.According to Jani, she was infected after the wife of a staff member who was asymptomatic. Though she had undergone a Rapid antigen in a testing camp in the village, the result was given only days later. By the time, the asymptomatic woman had passed the infection to others.Based on her own experience, Jani has suggested that there needs to be a lot of changes in our approach.Change this first. You have to create faith, belief in science & healthcare. It wont be easy but without this neither will u beat covid and nor do u have hope in ironing out Indias healthcare system issues.This fear against healthcare facilities makes people NOT report symptomsTesting : Why pray tell me after a year of this mad disease there is still NO effective testing process, robustness in rural areas. This MUST STOP. People in UP are even turned back from testing. You very well know -testing is the only way. Then why this randomness.How will you ever arrest this problem without effective testing protocol and turnaround. Virus will always be ahead of you. Winning. Killing and robbing you and the nation of its remaining dignity. So get into details - devil is literally there. How can we augment rural testing.Equip every panchayat ghar as an isolation centre with processes laid out for Asha workers to manage protocols. Supported by gram pradhan. If its too small then local PHC or covid care centre also. Right now panchayat Ghars that operate as isolation or quarantine centres ..Pay and protect Asha workers. Many states Asha workers and NHM workers not paid on time. This is the least u can ensure. But they also dont have PPE. I saw staff at GOVT hospital in Haldwani not have enough PPE. My own ICU bed had no sanitiser. Fix this. You know how to.Medication: everyone is over medicating. From ivermectin to remedisvir and fabi flu. You name it. Rural PHCs and Asha workers have been giving ivermectin when there are no symptoms or positivity even. Correct your medical protocols immediately. Make them data and science drivenIn a country like ours U need to look at price performance also. the time from drug discovery or researched application to mass production needs acceleration. U will need to call experts. Pls dont have your babus decide how to do this. You yourself said Babus cant do everythingIts not their job to do system thinking. Its yours. Its not their job to arrange supplies, expedite testing, revise protocols - its yours. Their job is patient care. Give them all the tools and support to do that. Dont waste their time with needless paperwork also.They want relief in terms of rest, they want better pay and they want basic visibility of how you are preparing so that we are not constantly catching up with the virus but that we are chasing it out. Where Is your detailed plan. You must have ONE.The rural spread of COVID-19, the full extend of which is still has been a major concern for the health care authorities. Even vaccination has been a big challenge in many remote villages due to the lack of awareness and fear created by misinformation circulated through Whatsapp.Neelam Kumari, a healthcare worker in rural Haryana told AFP that when she knocks on doors in villages the occupants sometimes run out the back, terrified that she wants to vaccinate them against Covid-19.""A lot of people in my village don't want to take the vaccine. They fear that they will die if they take it,"" Kumari told AFP. ""One of the villagers was so angry that he beat up a (health) worker who was trying to convince him to take the vaccine."""
542369," A more than a century-old seaside retreat in the Sunderbans, where India's colonial rulers once wined and dined has been swallowed by the hungry waves which lashed onto the beaches and forests when cyclone Yaas hit in May, as per PTI.Some broken portions of brick walls remain and that is all that is left of the Frasergunj residence, a spacious bungalow built by Sir Andrew Fraser, lieutenant governor of Bengal between 1903 and 1908. India's high society included the likes of Viceroy Lord George Curzon and they once danced away their nights to the sound of laughter of their ladies and tinkling of wine glasses, as live orchestras shipped down from Kolkata played in attendance.The historical bungalow which served as a retreat where the rulers of Bengal entertained the high and mighty, could not withstand the might of the storm surge the cyclone brought on May 26, Namkhana Block Development Officer (BDO) Santanu Singha Thakur said.Sir Andrew Fraser, had finished part of his planned retreat which boasted of a ballroom and a bar for the entertainment of the then capital of Indias high society, said Debisankar Middya, an archaeologist specialising in coastal Bengal.ANIFraser, born in the then Bombay Presidency in 1848 had joined the Indian Civil Service in 1871. He spotted the beach at Narayantala, and decided it was the ideal location for his retreat and probably started building the bungalow before he became the lieutenant governor, the top job in Bengal province, which then included Bihar, Odisha, modern Bangladesh, Assam and Meghalaya, besides West Bengal.Middya told PTI that a golf course had also been laid out by Fraser close to the bungalow. I had seen a remnant of the golf course during a visit, he said.The sea and the weather over the years, had already started running down parts of the historical residence probably built in 1901-02 on the highest dune in the area. The twin blows from Cyclone Amphan which hit the state last year and Yaas which hit the area last month, dealt the final blow to Frasers bungalow.ANIOnly a bathroom is still standing, Thakur said.Bricks that had been dislodged from the broken walls were strewn on the ground.The bungalow also had a museum in which stuffed carcasses of hunted animals were probably on display, Middya said.The archeologist said that Fraser had a larger plan to develop the area, referred to as Mecklenberg Island in contemporary Admiralty charts, and had cleared jungles in most parts of it, constructed roads and embankments, besides trying to set up a post-office and a school there.There was also a plan to develop the area as a health resort for the English elite who ruled India.However, the administration had to abandon the idea due to the huge cost involved in the project, failure to get farmers to settle in the locality and resistance by a small community of local fishermen.The area later came to be known as Fraserganj after the lieutenant governor, but with the sea and high tides lapping hungrily at it, it is difficult to predict for how long even the remains of Frasers dream retreat will stand."

542360," An unbelievably crazy love story has surfaced in Kerala where a man somehow managed to hide his lover from his family for 10 years while they all lived under the same roof.It all began in February 2010, when Sajitha, who was then 18 years old went missing after she left her parents' home in Ayilur village of Palakkad district.ScreengrabSajitha had left her parents' home to visit a relative nearby, but when she did not return they filed a police complaint.Though initially there were some investigations, it could not make any headway, and everyone including her family and the village accepted that she might have died.But to the shock of her parents and villagers, earlier this week it was revealed that Sajitha was alive and was until recently living in a house close to that of her parents.Since the day she went missing, Sajitha was living with her lover, a youth identified as Rahman, who was then 24 years old and belonged to the same village.Rahman and Sajitha were in a relationship and no one including both families or friends had any clue about it.Sajitha has been living in Rahman's room since the day she left her home.Rahman who is an electrician, used his skills to fit an automatic lock to the room, which was always kept locked for others. He even kept some connected electric wires outside the door, from which his kin got electric shocks a few times when they went near it.FacebookRahman also started acting weird with his family, which led to them thinking that he had some mental issues.His food habits also changed suddenly and he began having a lot, which he would never eat or drink with his family, but would take to his room.Sajitha who was hiding in the small room would only sneak out at night to use the toilet.The story unravelled on Tuesday when Rahman, who had gone missing from his home some three months ago was spotted by his brother Basheer, driving a bike in a nearby town.FacebookWhile Basheer who was driving a truck tried to stop him Rahman sped away after which he sought the help of the police.When stopped by the Police, Rahman told his brother that he was living with a girl in a rented house in a nearby village.After they were produced in the court the couple said they wanted to live together and all this was done fearing that their families won't accept their relationship."

But, his journey from Aligarh to Stanford University is inspiring to all those who think they won't be able to do better in life.His father, a small insurance salesman in UP's Akrabad village, faced some hurdles to meet the daily needs of the family. However, Manu being a bright student, always knew that he if kept studying, he would be able to succeed one day.Times NowI studied in the local government primary school in the village of Akrabad till grade 5. At the end of the year, I appeared for the entrance exam for Vidyagyan school and got selected. That was the year 2014, Manu told Times Now.Vidyagyan School is, a residential school run by Shiv Nadar Foundation for the underprivileged in Uttar Pradesh. Every year about 2,50,000 students from the smallest villages appear for the entrance which selects only 250 students. In 2014, Manu was one of the 250.Manu thanked his school for its various efforts and driven force and how it shaped his talent and pushed him towards doing better. He also said that his teachers were extremely encouraging at every step of the way. However, it was his father who is his real motivation.When back home during vacation, I would often hear my father and family talking about various policies. I was still young, but when I added my opinion, I was appreciated for the thought process. It was then that I knew that policy-making, political science was what I aspired for, Manu said.In Class 10, Manu scored 95.4 per cent in his board examinations and won an outstanding performance award in Assessment of Scholastic Skills through Educational Testing twice. He also became the best speaker in intra-class debate competitions and won a gold medal in Open State Level Table-Tennis championship in 2018.On asking about his choice of program in International Relations and Economics he shared that his dream was to work in the United Nations for the children of the world. Education can change everything. In India, we can provide infrastructure but the mentality of the people have to change. The teachers in government schools, especially in a village like ours, simply arent interested in teaching. I want to change that.Times NowWhen asked why he chose Stanford, he said, It is among the world's top universities and the research infrastructure is excellent. Indian Universities do not offer the opportunity of research. I want to bring change and that requires the right access which Stanford provides me.""The application process begins from Class 11 itself. I was counselled by the school counsellor and even had access to counsellors in Delhi who helped me understand the process and fill out my application form. I appeared for SATs and scored 1470 out of 1600,"" he added.When asked about the cancelled Class 12 board examinations, he said, There was no real impact. Admissions to universities abroad are subjective and the class 12 board marks were not that important. The admission was based on the performance over the years and the overall application. The essay also plays a crucial role.""As to whether he was happy with the decision of Class 12 getting cancelled, Manu shared he was rather disappointed. I was looking forward to the examinations and wanted to score over 95%. But now I dont know.He also revealed how he managed to pay for the application for the university, College Boards scholarship paid for my SAT exams. My school helped me with the application process. In fact, many people and institutions help students who dont have the means but have the will and the determination.Scholarship PositionsManu is super excited to start the next chapter in his life. He has already gotten his first dose of the vaccine and is waiting for the second dose. He hopes to fly in the first week of September.

I will also get vaccinated soon,"" he said.Earlier Ramdev had said that he didn't feel that he had to get vaccinated against COVID-19 as he has dual protection from the infection through Yoga and Ayurveda.Ramdev had been in the eye of the storm ever since several recent videos of him questioning modern medicine and vaccines in the context of COVID-19 surfaced.BCCLHe had also claimed that over 10,000 doctors had died after taking both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine and even went on to call modern medicine 'stupid science'.The IMA which did not take the comments by Ramdev launched a strong protest with the Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Varshan and even asked him to either accept what the Yoga guru said or take action against him.Accusing him of spreading misinformation and vaccine hesitancy in India, doctors across India had observed a black day demanding action against Ramdev.BCCLSeveral state units of the IMA have also sent legal notices to Ramdev over his comments.Speaking about the controversy, Ramdev said: ""Our fight is not with the doctors of the country, the doctors who are opposing us, they are not doing it through an institution.""""We want that nobody should be harassed in the name of medicines and people should refrain from unnecessary medication. There is no doubt that allopathy is better for emergency cases and surgeries. But other life-threatening diseases, incurable disorders can be cured through ancient practices listed in Yoga Ayurveda, which is not a matter of argument,"" said Ramdev.REUTERSSince July last year, Ramdev has been trying to sell Coronil, an ayurvedic drug developed by Patanjali Ayurved as a cure for COVID-19.After the company failed to substantiate its claims and questions were raised about the data, Patanjali had initially backtracked and said it was an immunity booster and that they never claimed it to cure COVID-19.Patanjali AyurvedaEarlier this year, Ramdev reintroduced Coronil with a claim that it was certified by Ayush Ministry and WHO.The WHO however rejected this and said it has 'not reviewed or certified the effectiveness of any traditional medicine for the treatment of Covid-19'."

542305," Ratko Mladi, the former Bosnian Serb commander nicknamed the butcher of Bosnia, will spend the rest of his life in prison after a UN court dismissed his final appeal against convictions for genocide and crimes against humanity, in a judgment hailed as historic by the White House.The judgment Tuesday means the 79-year-old former general who, terrorized Bosnia throughout the 1992-95 war will spend the rest of his days in prison. He is the last major figure from the conflict that ended more than a quarter century ago to face justice.APUnlike previous appearances at the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague, the chief showed little emotion as an hour-long reading of the judgment finally put an end to attempts to quash the charges against him. The ICTY is one of the predecessors of the International Criminal Court, the world's first permanent war crimes court.Mladis only words during the hearing were to respond Yes, I can when asked whether he was able to follow the proceedings. There was the odd shake of the head, but Mladis behaviour stood in sharp contrast to his final appearance during the original 2017 conviction, where he had shouted this is all lies and Ill fuck your mother, while gesticulating at the relatives of his victims.Presiding Judge Prisca Matimba Nyambe of Zambia said the court dismissed Mladics appeal in its entirety and affirmed his life sentence.ReutersMladic was convicted in 2017 on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, including terrorising the civilian population of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo during a 43-month siege, and the killing of more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica in 1995.Mladic joins his former political master, ex-Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic, in serving a life sentence for masterminding ethnic bloodshed in the Bosnian war that left more than 1,00,000 dead and millions homeless.APThe Australian who shot dead dozens of Muslim worshippers in a Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019 was believed to be inspired by the wartime Bosnian Serb leaders, as well as Anders Breivik, the Norwegian white supremacist who shot dead 77 people in Norway in 2011.APShortly after the judgment was delivered, Joe Biden described it as a moment of hope. This historic judgment shows that those who commit horrific crimes will be held accountable, the US president said.It also reinforces our shared resolve to prevent future atrocities from occurring anywhere in the world."""

Professor Espy-Wilson explains, The point is to alert the therapist if a patient needs to be seen so that they don't get severely depressed and possibly decide to commit suicide.The app would ask the user some basic questions on how theyre feeling and about their emotional well-being in the past week. It would ask the patients to record their answers verbally with their speech being recorded. They will also have an option of responding to the answers in a video, if they're comfortable with it. The video could enable further analysis through the facial movements of the subject.Also Read: Eating Meat May Improve Mental Health, While One In Three Vegans May Be DepressedGetty ImagesAccording to Professor Espy-Wilson, in a conversation with the Daily Mail, the app would look at their articulatory coordination, language and facial movements to understand the severity of depression.Also Read: Social Media Use During COVID-19 Linked With Depression And TraumaThis too would be highlighted in four levels -- mild, moderate, severe or very severe. If the app notices a striking change, proper people -- like the caregiver, patient and the therapist -- would be notified of the anomaly.The app is far from ready though, as Prof Espy-Wilson highlights that they are yet to conduct simulations and clinical trials to work out the details. But if it does become live, it could surely help save the lives of many who are suffering from major depression disorder or MDD."

542294," As Bihar's farmers struggle to avoid losing crops due to animal invasion and thefts, one IITian's startup could be the solution to their problems. As per The New Indian Express, IIT-Kharagpur alumnus Ajit Kumar has developed an artificial intelligence-driven Farm Surveillance-Cum-Animal Scarer (FSCAS).This helps farmers to keep animals and thieves away.According to Kumar, the gadget can be installed at key points on the farm. If it spots an animal or theft, it starts to blare. Also farmers get alerts in their mobile handsets. It is driven by artificial intelligence and has computerised sensors along with night-vision cameras.EPSKumar hails from Shyampur in Bhagalpur. He quit his MNC job and came up with this idea. The startup idea is called Stepupify and his batchmate Sagar Kumar is also involved.This device is battery powered and can be mounted on a pole or tree in the field along with installed solar panels to charge the battery. It can be customised as per farmers request and has been tested in the fields at Khirighat (Antichak) in Kahalgaon sub-division, he said.PTIRight now its price is Rs 15,000.""The sensor immediately identifies any attempt to intrude into the field.

The chat was organised by RightsCon -- a platform that focussed on human rights in the digital world.Prince said in a statement, What we are seeing out of India, so far, it appears to be erring more towards a Chinese model.

""When we began to write Part 5 in the midst of the pandemic, we felt that we had to change what was expected from the ten-episode season and used every tool we could to create the sensation of a season finale or series finale in the first volume itself,"" said Money Heist creator lex Pina and added, ""We decided to work in an extremely aggressive genre, putting The Gang on the ropes. In volume 2, we focus more on the emotional situation of the characters. It is a journey across their sentimental map that connects us directly to their departure"".Yes, the first action-packed teaser was released on May 24 along with the announcement of the release date.InstagramAs per the latest development, two new actors have joined the cast.

The end of the greatest heist in history is approaching, and what began as a robbery will turn into a war.""NetflixThe female robbers won't be let down in season 5. They will lead to a twist in the end. ""Are they going to play a crucial role at certain times? I would say very, very crucial. And weve added a new twist involving women in this fifth season,"" Pina told the Indian Express.TwitterPedro Alonso alias Berlin is dead in the show but often appears in flashbacks. Talking about season 5, he said, ""Its going to be rocknroll, because from what Ive seen, youre making a war movie but within four walls.

""The last battle has been the biggest and the hardest, and we have fought it to the last breath. Because we wanted to give you the most epic, most spectacular and most exciting season of all. The result is for you. And for us the journey. And without a doubt, colleagues, it has been worth it,"" he wrote on Instagram.NetflixWhile Money Heist will end after season 5 but that doesn't mean you won't get to see your favourite characters back in action. In conversation with Oprah Magazine, showrunner Alex Pina floated the idea of spin-offs. ""We do have many possibilities for some spinoffs, yes, and I think thats thanks to the strong and powerful identities of the characters. Weve always looked for characters to have a very complex, layered design. So I think almost every character of Money Heist has a duality that we would like to see in a spinoff. We could watch any of them in other contexts."" So, maybe this is not the end.Twitter""Omg youre going to freak out with the fifth #LCDP5,"" she had written on Instagram.

In an online lecture on April 6, she detailed the futility of talking to White people about race, dismissing the exercise as a waste of breath. She recalled how her white therapist had called her anger on racism psychotic.We are asking a demented, violent predator who thinks that they are a saint or a superhero to accept responsibility.

Samantha is a fair girl in real life but was shown brown in the show.Crushing the criticism around the skin colour of Samantha in The Family Man 2, creators Raj & DK in an interview with Film Companion said,This whole thing comes in the context of beauty, when you're trying to say dark skin is not beautiful and fair skin is beautiful... This is not that context, number one. There is no context of skin beauty in this. We are all shades of brown. Now, the idea is that if each one is a shade of brown, so it's not about getting a different race to play this (character). It's not a race thing either. These are the two contexts where it should be looked down upon, and that's where the main problem is. And we are well aware of it; it's not like we are irresponsible filmmakers, to propagate something of that kind.TwitterThe directors clearly dissed the criticism around the colour related to the caste or race. He insisted that Raji is a soldier in the show and she is a weather beaten girl and thats how they look.Here, we are trying to get the character of Raji right. We want her to speak it, we want her to look it, we want her to be that action girl who can land the punch; someone who can be physically fit and take on a guy double her size. That's our main challenge. So if you look at what she wears... She's a soldier, she's a weather-beaten girl, there's no time for worrying about self-care. If you're a solider in the Himalayas, your face is going to be red, that's the makeup.PrimeVideoHope the criticism around the skin colour ends as Samantha doesnt deserve any negativity as she is just mind blowing as Raji in the Family Man 2.

542192," Even as the tug-of-war over the stock of COVID-19 vaccine seems to come to an end with PM Narendra Modi announcing reshuffling the policy, it has become imperative to understand what is our national vaccination policy all about. Let's take a look.The Indian national policy on vaccine came into existence in 2011 after a dictate by Delhi High Court to Government of India to frame a national policy on dealing with introduction of new vaccines in National Immunization Program (NIP).AFPA meeting of National Technical Advisory Group of Immunization (NTAGI) was called in August 2010, and sub-sequently, in September 2010, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) requested Ex-Director General of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to draft first ever NVP.The main purpose of this endeavor was to guide decision-making regarding various aspect of immunization, and to develop a long-term plan to strengthen the whole vaccine program in the country.Other objectives of the national vaccine policy:1. To contribute to prevention of mortality and morbidity due to communicable diseases.2. To ensure consistent delivery and administration of vaccines to everyone in need.3. To achieve national self-reliance in vaccine research & development (R&D).File Photo4. To achieve pre-eminence in the capabilities of the indigenous public sector for self-reliance.5. To develop and use the interdisciplinary knowledge base.6. To promote ethical conduct in the development, trials, adoption and administration of vaccines.7. To develop a system for monitoring and compensating Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI).8. To enable India to play a leading role in the supply of affordable vaccines.9. To synergize all relevant policies for effective implementation of the national vaccine policy.BCCLImmunization has been one of the greatest success stories of the 2000s and vaccines have proved to be the great public health tools. One disease, smallpox, had been eradicated; later poliomyelitis was eradicated too. India has been using vaccines since late 1970s in its NIP and currently running one of the largest mass immunization programs in the world.Though polio elimination was achieved in the country through the limb of Universal Immunization Program (UIP) in India, the performance of the overall program in many other fields was still far from satisfactory. The Indian vaccine industry has also made great inroads in the national as well as global vaccine scenario and now regarded as a major force at international arena.india vaccine shortageWith the availability of many new vaccines in the private sector in the country and at international level, the government is under pressure to introduce them in its NIP. However, scarcity of funds, and more importantly, the lack of competent technical advice are crippling its decision making prowess."

When the sudden lockdown was announced, some of us felt that people who are living under the Western Express Highway might not be getting food. So, it started as a one-off drive to feed them. But once we were on the ground we got to know the magnitude of the crisis.

At the peak, we were handing out almost one lakh meal kits in a day. After the word spread about our work we had some 250 volunteers who helped us coordinate the work from finding the needy to mapping them and making sure that they get one meal a day. During the migrant exodus we even had volunteers at three railway stations and served around 270 trains, with 2,000 people on an average"" Shetty explained.Khaana ChahiyeEven after the lockdown was lifted, many vulnerable people found it difficult to survive the crisis. With the experience, they gained during the lockdown and information from their volunteers and network of NGOs Khaana Chahiye built a 'hunger map', which helped to identify the people in need and the kind of support each specific group needed, which also proved to be useful during the second lockdown.Khaana Chahiye""The lockdown this year is different. Last year, it was mostly the migrant workers and daily wage workers who got affected. But this year a lot of lower-middle calls families who never in the past had to worry about their next meal were also facing the crisis. So, we changed our approach and put more focus on the distribution of grocery kits.""This year we have distributed more than 13 lakh meals till now. We have also distributed 15-16 thousand grocery kits till now. Right now, we are reducing the number of meals, which at the peak was nearly 40,000 a day, and trying to increase the ration kits. A typical ration kit, which is approximately worth Rs 800 which should sustain a family for 8-10 days,"" Shetty said.Khaana ChahiyeThough Khaana Chahiye got some financial support from a few corporate companies, the initiative is still largely driven by crowdfunding.""Our focus now is on grocery kits, as we feel that it is a more dignified way of doing things. But with the funds that we have collected so far, Khaana Chahiye can sustain till around 18th June. But a good portion of those getting the 10,000 meals and 1,000 food kits a day, will need a refill even after that, which for us is a challenge now. We still anticipate an increase in the demand in the coming days,"" Shetty said.With this in mind, Khaana Chahiye is aiming to raise found through an online crowdfunding campaign.Khaana ChahiyeIn addition to the cooked meals and grocery kits, Khaana Chahiye is also trying to create local employment through small community kitchens, which act as a cheaper alternative for the meal packet and can cater to the specific needs of the community for which the food is served."

542184," 56-year-old great-granddaughter of Mahatma Gandhi, who was accused of a Rs 3.22 crore fraud and forgery case, got seven years in jail by a Durban court, as per PTI.Ashish Lata Ramgobin was found guilty of the charges against her.She was accused of defrauding businessman SR Maharaj after he advanced R6.2 million to her for allegedly clearing import and Customs duties for a non-existent consignment from India. He was promised a share of profits.Lata Ramgobin, who is the daughter of noted rights activists Ela Gandhi and late Mewa Ramgobind, was also refused leave to appeal both the conviction and the sentence by the Durban Specialised Commercial Crime Court.When trial in the case against Lata Ramgobin started in 2015, Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) had said that she allegedly provided forged invoices and documents to convince potential investors that three containers of linen were being shipped in from India.ReutersAt that time, Lata Ramgobin was released on a bail of 50,000 rand.On Monday, the court during the hearing was informed that Lata Ramgobin had met Maharaj, director of the New Africa Alliance Footwear Distributors, in August 2015. The company imports and manufactures and sells clothing, linen and footwear.Maharajs company also provides finance to other companies on a profit-share basis.Lata Ramgobin had told Maharaj that she had imported three containers of linen for the South African Hospital Group NetCare.She said she was experiencing financial difficulties to pay for import costs and customs and she needed the money to clear the goods at the harbour, NPA spokesperson Natasha Kara said on Monday.She advised him (Maharaj) that she needed R 6.2 million.

Later that month, she sent him what seemed to be a NetCare invoice and delivery note as proof that the goods were delivered and payment was imminent, she said.TwitterLata Ramgobin further sent him confirmation from NetCares bank account that payment had been made, Kara said.Because of Ramgobins family credentials and NetCare documents, Maharaj had entered into a written agreement with her for the loan.However, after Maharaj found out that the documents were forged and NetCare had no arrangements with Lata Ramgobin, he laid criminal charges.Ramgobin was founder and executive director of the Participative Development Initiative at the NGO International Centre for Non-Violence, where she described herself as an activist with focus on environmental, societal and political interests.A number of other descendants of Mahatma Gandhi are human rights activists and among them are Lata Ramgobins cousins Kirti Menon, the late Satish Dhupelia, and Uma Dhupelia-Mesthrie."

542179," Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation on Monday on the COVID-19 situation in India and said that the Union government will take over the vaccination drive to vaccinate the 18-44 age group along with the over-45 age group in the country. From June 21, the Union government will vaccinate those above the age of 18 for free. Let's take a look at how the vaccine policy changed within a couple of months and then weeks, and what was it's subsequent effect.TwitterJanuary 16, 2021India began inoculating health workers in what was likely the world's largest Covid-19 vaccination campaign, joining the ranks of wealthier nations where the effort was already underway.April 19, 2021A month and a half ago, Indias Union Government introduced sudden changes to its vaccination policy that it said would liberalise and accelerate Indias campaign to inoculate all adults. At the time we called some of the moves baffling and talked about how they seemed like a panicked reaction to an unforeseen second wave.Over the last two weeks, a few more opinions on the policy have emerged.iStockMay 21, 2021Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed on the need to remove vaccine hesitancy and said that the Central government was making every effort that a fortnightly supply schedule for vaccines to various States be provided to streamline supply and prevent wastage.May 27, 2021NITI Aayog, the Centres think tank, made it very clear that the Union Government knew how misguided some elements of the new strategy were, giving the impression  that it chose those policies just to spite the states.The states very well knew the production capacity in the country and what the difficulties are in procuring vaccines directly from abroad. In fact, GoI ran the entire vaccine program from January to April & it was quite well-administrated compared to the situation in May. But states, who had not even achieved good coverage of healthcare workers and frontline workers in 3 months wanted to open up the process of vaccination and wanted more decentralisation. Health is a state subject & the liberalised vaccine policy was a result of the incessant requests being made by the states to give states more power. In other words, the Centre said, via NITI Aayog, that it knew this was a bad policy. And yet, it claims  dishonestly, as we point out below  that it was pressured into instituting this bad policy.AFPJune 2, 2021The Supreme Court of India concluded that the Centres decision to not provide free vaccination to Indians between the ages of 18 and 44 was prima facie, arbitrary and irrational. A number of chief ministers of various states have called for the Union Government to return to the earlier approach of it procuring all vaccines, instead of the fragmented approach it chose in the new policy.June 7, 2021Cut to Monday when PM Modi after weeks of policy paralysis, announced a big U-turn in the country's vaccination procurement policy. Blaming the states for the lapses, he alleged that the states started seeing the problems in procuring vaccines themselves. They started gauging how difficult it is to go about the processes, he said.This U-turn comes only at a time when the deadly second COVID surge is subsiding and after many thousands of deaths.APThe Centre now wants to portray its much-criticised policy as the outcome of flawed demands of Opposition states. Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan implied that the Centre ditched a perfect policy because of state pressure, a claim that says more about his Bharatiya Janata Party than the Opposition.Wrote to 11 CMs in the spirit of Cooperative Federalism. Quite unfortunate that Centre absolves itself of its duty to procure vaccines, ensure free universal vaccination. United effort to jointly pursue our genuine demand is the need of the hour, so that Centre acts immediately. there is little indication here that Prime Minister Narendra Modis famously centralising government suddenly discovered its federalist principles in vaccine policy and started listening to the states. The Centres new policy seems quite evidently to be a panicked reaction to quieten the barrage of criticism following a brutal second wave that it completely failed to anticipate.AgenciesChief ministers of Opposition states like Kerala and Jharkhand asked the Centre to procure vaccines for all, as most central governments the world over have done. Even the chief ministers of Odisha and Telangana, who have tended to vote with the Bharatiya Janata Party in Parliament, have spoken up against the fragmented procurement  though, typically, they have addressed their comments to fellow chief minsters, rather than Modi.The Supreme Court had on May 31 pronounced a strongly-worded judgement pointing out the flaws and lacunae in the COVID vaccination policy adopted by the Central government.TOIAmong other things, the Supreme Courts judgment in the suo moto case  meaning one that it started hearing on its own, without any petition  on Covid-related matters includes several paragraphs spent telling the Centre that its website for vaccine registration needs drop-down menus and keyboard shortcuts to aid disabled users. Why the top court of the land has to use its time giving basic directions on website design to the Centre, which had a whole year to put together the site, is hard to answer.CoWinThe order continues the trend of the court asking straightforward questions to the Centre for information on vaccine policy that it ought to have provided to the public anyway, months ago. It asks:BCCLEven after a detailed presentation by the Prime Minister on Monday, these questions above remain unanswered."

542158," Oscar Pistorius's Paralympic career was more or less over once he was put on trial for murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in 2014. He was found guilty of murder after a South African appeals court overturned a manslaughter verdict. The man remains in jail.But even then the double-amputee blade-runner from South Africa did not lose his eight Paralympic medals - six gold, a silver and a bronze.This is a classic case to quote in relation to the two Olympic medals won by Indian wrestler Sushil Kumar, who is one of the accused in a murder case involving a young wrestler.It can be safely said that the medals won't be taken away from Sushil by the International Olympic Committee, regardless of the outcome of the current investigation and any future trial, as per TOI. There is no precedent of athletes losing their Olympic medals after being involved in a criminal offence.The Olympic Charter, which is also followed by the Paralympics, mentions violations related to ""Olympic Charter, the World Anti-Doping Code, or of any other decision or applicable regulation issued by the IOC or any IF (International Federation) or NOC (National Olympic Committee), including but not limited to the IOC Code of Ethics, the Olympic Movement Code on the Prevention of Manipulation of Competitions or of any applicable public law or regulation, or in case of any form of misbehaviour.""Mentioned in Chapter 6 (Measures and Sanctions, Disciplinary Procedures and Dispute Resolution) of the charter, point 2.1 says that individual competitors or teams found in breach of the above can face ""temporary or permanent ineligibility or exclusion from the Olympic Games, disqualification or withdrawal of accreditation.""PTIIt adds: ""In the case of disqualification or exclusion, the medals and diplomas obtained in relation to the relevant infringement of the Olympic Charter shall be returned to the IOC. In addition, at the discretion of the IOC Executive Board, a competitor or a team may lose the benefit of any ranking obtained in relation to other events at the Olympic Games at which he or it was disqualified or excluded. In such a case, the medals and diplomas won by him or it shall be returned to the IOC (Executive Board).For the record, Sushil is the only Indian to win two individual Olympic medals. He won a bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and followed it up with a silver at the 2012 London Games.No mention of a criminal offence is made in the Charter.For the record, Sushil is the only Indian to win two individual Olympic medals. He won a bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and followed it up with a silver at the 2012 London Games.However, the status of Sushil's national honours, including the Padma Shri, Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna and Arjuna, will be up to the discretion of the President of India and the Ministry of Sports in case he is found guilty in the murder trial.PTIAccording to the statutes of the Padma Awards: ""The President may cancel and annul the award of the decoration to any person and thereupon his name shall be erased from the Register and he shall be required to surrender the decoration and the Sanad. But it shall be competent for the President to restore the decoration and the Sanad and to withdraw the orders of cancellation and annulment.""Former Home Secretary N Gopalaswami had earlier told TOI - ""After a chargesheet is filed, the award may be cancelled by the President. If at all he is acquitted later, the orders cancelling the award can always be withdrawn.""Sushil was awarded the Padma Shri in 2011, Khel Ratna in 2009 and the Arjuna award in 2006."

542123," It may sound near impossible that health workers trekking the hilly terrains on the daily basis to get the people vaccinated but this is the reality. In north Kashmirs two blocks- Uri and Boniyar, the heath workers are walking several kilometres, ensuring that they reach out directly to the beneficiaries living in the mountains.Most of these areas have either no Internet connectivity or poor Internet service. These villages fall close to Line of Control (LoC), the highly fortified zones.Every morning, one can see the small teams of health workers, including men and women - wearing the white aprons and medical toolkits in their hands - leaving for their destinations with a hope to vaccinate everyone.It is an enthusiasm to vaccinate everyone so that they stay safe, Dr Parvaiz Masoodi, Block Medical Officer Boniyar told Indiatimes.Idrees BukhtiyarOver 60% of population in Uri and over thirty five areas are living in hilly areas and that too without Internet facility. Online booking of vaccination slots in these areas is not required. We do it ourselves, Dr Masoodi said.Sharing the experience of vaccinating the people near Indo-Pak borders, Masoodi said, My team trekked kilometers in the hilly terrains to reach in a village despite weather vagaries. We crossed the gushing rivers, streams and even walked on the muddy roads but I am proud that we have achieved a milestone.Dr Masoodi said, We have been sending the mobile teams of 5-6 people in every village and in those areas also that are not motorable. After vaccinating people and once reaching back in the Internet zone, we upload their data on the CoWin app.Idrees BukhtiyarAs per the data obtained from the Health Department, 99.73 percent people in 45 and above age bar have been vaccinated. I call it is 100% vaccination because some 39 people have been left only who are reluctant but we are motivating them and they too will be covered soon, he said.Calling it an achievement, Dr Masoodi said, We got all the vaccination done in just 25 days.Idrees BukhtiyarThe BMO credits his staff and doctors for achieving such a good number in a short span of time.After they use to come back from the different villages at 6 in the evening, I have holding the meetings with them despite them being tired and exhausted. We plan the things for the next day, he said.The interesting thing is that many doctors use to continue their night duties despite going in the field for the vaccination, he said.Sometime back many rumours surfaced on social media regarding the COVID-19 vaccines, but Dr Masoodi said he debunked them and created awareness about getting vaccinated. I roped in local Imams, social activists and media people who took out a message that importance of vaccination.Now, hopefully we are seeing good results on the ground, he said.In many areas, we involved Army to create the awareness regarding the vaccines. They told their porters to get the jab or not to come here. This helped us a lot.He said that in many cases they wrote vaccinated on the ration copies of the villagers who got the vaccination done. This would help them to get the ration easily, he said.Dr Masoodi added that over 85% of migrated people have also been vaccinated.Idrees BukhtiyarAs per the official data, 92 per cent people in the age group of 45 and above have been vaccinated so far in Uri.Our health teams have been visiting the LoC areas and villages with no road and internet connectivity. They get the data in the offline mode and then upload it in the office, says Mohammad Ramzan Mir, Block Medical Officer (BMO) Uri.Ramzan said that they are ready for the second dose of vaccination for 45 and above age category.We are getting the new stock within days and will begun door-to-door vaccination process in Uri and its remote areas, he said.As per the health officials, 3,000 people have been vaccinated so far in block Boniyar and 1, 500 in block Uri in the age group of 18-44.Idrees BukhtiyarLeave the internet facility, our village doesnt have the proper road connectivity. It gets closed for the weeks when it rains. But people in a good number have been vaccinated here, said Lal Din Khatana, Sarpanch Charunda village close to the LoC.We have a health centre in the village and people were called over there and received the first dose of the vaccine. Despite being a far off area, vaccination facilities have been made available in the centre, said Masrat Jamal, Sarpanch Lachipora village."

The truth will be decided in the trial"".DCP STATEMENT on minor girl case also said that the complaint has been lodged after the ""father of the victim had lodged a complaint in Versova police station claiming that their daughter has fallen prey to sexual assault.

We have conducted the medical examination and have also recorded the statement of the accused under CRPC 164"".The case is getting murkier now as Ekta Kapoor's conversation with the victim's mother has gone viral. In the audio, she claims that Puri is innocent and that his name has been embroiled in the controversy because of her estranged husband, who she says is trying to malign her image. She also revealed why she did not go to the Police station to record her statement.Dear privileged Girls and Women, Do not make the heinous allegations of rape and molestation so frivolous and casual that it ceases to hold any value for posterity. You have my support.I stand with . I doubt he can do something like this ever  he is a soft spoken well behaved guy. The truth shall be out .. till then stay strong Pearl. #istandwithpearl hope the truth comes out and justice is served."

We all know that.""As for suggestions that the ECB should have investigated Robinson's social media history prior to his England debut, Root said: ""We can look back about how this could have been handled better, but the fact is it shouldn't have happened.""And if we continue to keep trying to better the game right now, then in years to come this shouldn't be an issue.""We've got to move forward from this, learn from this and do everything we can to make sure it doesn't happen again.""Robinson has a separate employment contract with Sussex so he is free to play, if selected, for the south coast county during his international suspension."

We wish him all the best for the rest of the season.""Seven-times Grand Slam champion Mats Wilander paid tribute to Federer for his performance against Koepfer.AFP""I feel good that I saw Roger was in good enough shape to play like that,"" Eurosport pundit Wilander said. ""You have a lot of people say they should retire when they get a little bit old if they cannot win a Slam.""I am of the complete opposite opinion. I absolutely love and respect Roger Federer for what he did last night. He could have easily thrown in the towel and say 'I had a good enough practice for Wimbledon'.""But no, he wants to win matches, I am just so impressed with him."""

542099," In the 40 years since the first cases of what would later be known as AIDS were documented, scientists have made big leaps in HIV treatment, transforming what was once a death sentence into a manageable condition, as per AFP.What is still missing is a vaccine that would train human immune systems to ward off the infection.Here's the state of play on some of these efforts, which experts see as the ""holy grail"" in the fight to eliminate a virus that 38 million people live with globally.More people than ever now have access to medications called antiretroviral therapy or ART, which when taken as prescribed, keeps down the amount of virus in their body.This keeps them healthy and unable to transmit HIV to their partners.Beyond ART, people at high risk for infection can now get pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, a pill taken every day that reduces the risk of infection by 99 percent.""But access to medication is not organized in every part of the world,"" Hanneke Schuitemaker, global head of viral vaccine discovery at Johnson & Johnson's Janssen Vaccines, told AFP.Even within wealthy countries, wide socio-economic and racial disparities exist in accessing these medicines, and vaccines have historically been the most effective tools to eradicate infectious diseases.J&J is currently carrying out two human efficacy trials for its HIV vaccine candidate, and initial results from one of them may come as early as ""the end of this year,"" Schuitemaker said.Vaccines against Covid-19 were developed in record time and have shown remarkable levels of safety and efficacy, helping drive down caseloads in the countries fortunate enough to have wide access.GoogleMany of these shots were developed using technologies that were previously being tried out on HIV -- so why haven't we had breakthroughs yet?""The human immune system doesn't self cure HIV, whereas what was very clear was the human immune system was quite capable of self curing Covid-19,"" Larry Corey, principal investigator of HVTN, a global organization funding HIV vaccine development, told AFP.Covid vaccines work by eliciting antibodies that bind to the virus' spike protein and stop it from infecting human cells.HIV also has spike-shaped proteins on its surface, which are the target of HIV vaccine development.But while Covid has several of well-known variants circulating worldwide, HIV has hundreds or thousands of variants inside each infected person, William Schief, an immunologist leading development of an mRNA HIV vaccine at Scripps Research Institute told AFP.Because it's a ""retrovirus"" it quickly incorporates itself into its host's DNA. An effective vaccine will need to stop the infection dead in its tracks, not just reduce the amount of virus and leave the remainder to stay with the person forever.Efforts to develop a vaccine have been going on for decades but have so far all ended in failure.Last year, a study called Uhambo that was taking place in South Africa and involved the only vaccine candidate ever shown to provide some protection against the virus frustratingly ended in failure.J&J's vaccine candidate is currently being trialed in 2,600 women in sub-Saharan Africa in the Imbokodo trial, which is expected to report results in the coming months.It's also being tested in around 3,800 men who have sex with men and transgender individuals across the US, South America and Europe in the Mosaico trial.AFPThe J&J vaccine uses similar adenovirus technology to its Covid-19 vaccine, in other words a genetically modified cold virus delivers genetic cargo carrying instructions for the host to develop ""mosaic immunogens"" -- molecules capable of inducing an immune response to a wide variety of HIV strains.This is followed up by directly injecting synthetic proteins in later doses.Another promising approach is to try to generate ""broadly neutralizing antibodies"" (bnAbs) which bind to areas of the HIV virus that are common across its many variants.The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and Scripps Research recently announced results from an early stage trial showing their mRNA vaccine candidate, developed with Moderna, stimulated the production of rare immune cells that create bnAbs.Their strategy, explained Schief, is to use a sequence of shots to try to gradually educate antibody producing B-cells. They also hope to train up another kind of white cell, known as T-cells, to kill any cells that still get infected despite the antibodies.Efficacy trials are still a long way off, but he's hopeful the mRNA technology, which turn the body's cells into vaccine factories and has proven its worth against Covid-19, can make the difference."

542087," We all get burnout at our jobs - it's no secret. It's more than exhaustion and could linger for many days or sometimes, months. And it's definitely not something to be ashamed of. What's burnout, you may ask?Well, according to Help Guide, ""burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. It occurs when you feel overwhelmed, emotionally drained, and unable to meet constant demands.""DiceUnfortunately, not everyone has the means and resources to quit their jobs when they feel drained out and that is why, we see so many people, just physically and mentally exhausted, getting through life one day at a time.Penning his experience on the subject, a journalist shared his thoughts on Twitter and it seems that a lot many people resonate with his feelings. The thread is now going viral on the microblogging website. Journalist Somesh Jha shared the thread about his personal experience with feeling burnout.It has been over a month since I took a major step back and left my job, thanks to something called #burnout. I had hit a wall.... A thread:Burnout is beyond exhaustion. Not only do you feel that you have no energy left to work, even if it's the kind of work that you enjoy, you also feel detached. Cynicism takes over, efficiency takes a hit and nothing seems to pull you up.In past 8 years, journalism has not only been a career, it has been my calling. I TOTALLY LOVE digging stories & holding the system accountable. I worked at (an often unhealthy) neck-breaking pace but that's something I enjoyed doing until...burnout hit me, & it hit pretty hard.Suddenly, I lost all motivation to chase a story. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the feeling of emotional, physical and mental exhaustion. As a policy reporter, meeting people is a core part of the job and the pandemic only made things worse.However, as much as it may seem personal, burnout is actually not an individual issue... if one goes by the literature:""Research has definitively shown that burnout is an organisational problem, not an individual one."" a simple analogy - if you burn your bread in a toaster, the problem is not with the bread.Also, leaving a job is a privilege and that's why the best way to deal with burnout is to prevent it.A burnout can shatter your confidence like nothing else & it can make you feel drained. If you are feeling burnt out like me - don't doubt yourself. The first step is to identify the problem & the cause. Don't be harsh on yourself or blame yourself. Because it is NOT your fault.Plenty of journalists have spoken out about burnout, especially in the west where the topic of mental health is not ridiculed or pushed under the carpet, unlike in many organisations in India. realised the problem sooner than later helped me make some really good decisions and a break is just what I need. I hope to bounce back and continue with the dig :)Keep a check on your mental as well as physical health."

The car suffered serious damage. Even the semi had to be towed!Reports said the Chevy had first sideswiped a pickup truck whose driver started following the car thinking the driver was impaired.""He discovered the driver of the other vehicle was not impaired but was in fact a 9-year-old female driving with her 4-year-old sister,"" said West Valley City Police Lt.

There was no warrant against me by the law enforcement authorities in India when I left India to seek medical treatment in the United States of America, he went on to say.TOITOI is in possession of the eight-page signed submission.Choksi fled India in January 2018, just days before his name was to surface in the Rs 13.500 crore PNB scam, and settled in Antigua.He has not returned to the country since, as he faces investigation by CBI, ED and other Indian agencies on charges of criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust, cheating and dishonesty, corruption and money laundering.In the deposition, filed on June 3, he also declared that he has no intention of absconding and claimed that the Red Corner Interpol notice is not an international warrant and merely a request to facilitate surrender.This was in reply to the prosecution charge of him being a flight risk and that he is engaged in extradition proceedings in Antigua connected to alleged crimes committed by him in India.I have no intention of absconding from attending court in Dominica The presence of the Red Notice does not make me a flight risk. The Red Notice is not an international arrest warrant. It is merely a request by Interpol on behalf of India to locate and take steps to facilitate my surrender to India through extradition proceedings. The proceedings have already commenced in Antigua and Barbuda. Therefore, I do not intend to leave Dominica unless to travel to Antigua with the permission of the court, Choksi said, appending a document to the affidavit, explaining the purpose of the Red Corner notice from the Interpol website.There are two pending cases (both filed by me) before the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court in Antigua and Barbuda to determine whether I should be extradited to India. I have diligently attended every one of my court sessions in Antigua I am a law-abiding citizen and have no previous convictions, Choksi said attaching a copy of his citizenship, which he obtained in 2013.TOIIn the affidavit, the wanted fugitive diamantaire also gave a blow-by-blow account of his alleged abduction on May 23 and alleged the role of government authorities in Dominica in it. He also claimed that his health problems will worsen if he is denied bail.I fear that my health may drastically decline if I am kept in police custody. I am 62 years old and have serious health problems. I am a diabetic, have a brain clot, have heart problems and other medical issues, he said seeking bail.Choksi faces charges of illegal entry into Dominica but says he will not flee the country till the case is disposed of.If required I am willing to provide cash bail in a reasonable sum... I am able to afford living accommodation in Dominica until the hearing and determination of this charge of illegal entry. I am also able to afford my own security and so do not need any security from the State, he has submitted."

542073," Leopards now are ruling a tiger reserve, which is famous for taking the first censor before independence - 1932.It sounds strange but it's for real that a reserve that once took pride in its tiger populace is now a safe haven for 150 or so leopards. Tourists these days flock to Palamu Tiger Reserve to spot leopards, as per PTI. Officials say there has been no tiger sighting since a tigress was found dead in February 2020 near Betla National Park.""We now have about 150 leopard population, which has become an attraction for tourists coming to Palamu Tiger Reserve (PTR)...Happy tourists are often seen taking photographs with the leopards' leap...However, we are making all efforts to facilitate the return of the tigers,"" Chief Conservator of Forest (CCF) and Project Director, PTR YK Das told PTI.Attributing ""left-wing extremism activities, movement of security personnel, increased human encroachment and depleting prey bases in core and buffer zones of the reserve spread across about 1130 square km"" as the main reasons behind the big cats abandoning the once safe haven and migrating to neighbouring Chhattisgarh, Odisha etc, Das said restoration of prey base among other measures were on to lure them back, Das said.He said that though no tigers were detected in the last All India Tiger Estimation, one tigress was found dead in PTR in February 2020 which establishes that the tiger was there.""We are working on a relocation project to preserve PTR's ecology and improve its prey base to facilitate the return of tigers. Initially, we will be relocating inhabitants of two villages - Latu and Kujrum to outside PTR...The relocation project involves a 300 square km area, which is human-infested. We will be relocating 22 families of these two villages, who have agreed to it,"" Das said.PTIThe plan is to provide a family unit of either Rs 15 lakh for relocation of Rs 10 lakh and 5 acres of land to areas with community living including roads and other facilities, he said. The project is being implemented at a cost of Rs 26 crore, he said.A total of eight villages - Kujrum, Latu, Ramandag, Hainar, Gutucha, Vijaypur, Gopkhad and Pandra have been identified for relocation to places outside the tiger reserve with Latu and Kurjum falling under phase one.Of the 1129.93 sq km area of PTR, 414.08 sq km is marked as core area (critical tiger habitat) and the rest 715.85 sq km as buffer area. Of the total area, 226.32 sq.km is designated as Betla national park. In the buffer zone, 53 sq km is marked as a tourist zone.Palamu was declared a protected forest reserve in 1973-74 when Project Tiger was launched.The reserve, according to information, recorded its highest tiger population in 1995 with 71 big cats but since then their population has been dwindling with only three recorded in 2014 and as per the recent 2019 estimation there was no tiger in it.PTIThree tiger reserves in the country - Mizoram, West Bengal and Jharkhand showed zero population in the latest report.The Palamau Tiger Reserve, located at a distance of about 170 km from state capital Ranchi via Latehar, consists mainly of Sal forests, mixed deciduous forests and bamboo groves. The reserve zone is the watershed area for three important rivers Koel, Burha and Auranga.The Palamau Tiger Reserve was one of the first 9 tiger reserves created in the country at inception of Project Tiger and has the distinction of being the first sanctuary in the world in which a tiger census was carried out as a pugmark count, as early as 1932 under the supervision of JW Nicholson, the then DFO, Palamau.Apart from leopards, it houses elephants, grey wolf, gaur, sloth bear, four- horned antelope, Indian ratel, Indian otter and Indian pangolin to name a few.There are 11 Schedule- I species distributed in PTR among mammals only. In total, 47 species of mammals and 174 species of birds have been identified, as per officials who said that apart from these, a total of 970 species of plants, 17 species of grass and 56 species of medicinal plants have also been identified."
542071," Over 9.2 lakh children in India are 'severely acute malnourished', with the most in Uttar Pradesh followed by Bihar, said government data as per PTI. COVID is definitely one of the factors.An estimated 9,27,606 'severely acute malnourished' children between the ages of six months and six years were identified across the nation till November 2020, the Women and Child Development Ministry said in response to an RTI query. Uttar Pradesh counted for 3,98,359 and Bihar 2,79,427 as per the ministry. Ladakh, Lakshadweep, Nagaland, Manipur and Madhya Pradesh reported no severely malnourished children.The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines 'severe acute malnutrition' (SAM) by very low weight-for-height or a mid-upper arm circumference less than 115 mm, or by the presence of nutritional oedema. Children suffering from SAM have very low weight for their height, and are nine times more likely to die in case of diseases due to their weakened immune system.The Women and Child Development Ministry had last year asked all states and union territories to identify SAM children for their early referral to hospitals. The figure of 9,27,606 came following that exercise.The worry is that the numbers could not just be an underestimation but also rise in view of the ongoing pandemic with fears that the third wave could impact children more than others.""There is rise in unemployment, there is rise in an economic crisis which is bound to have repercussions on hunger and when there is hunger there will be malnutrition. The government has a clear cut protocol and they need to ramp that up,"" Enakshi Ganguly, co-founder of the HAQ Center for Child Rights, said.While Uttar Pradesh and Bihar top the list for SAM children, they are also home to the highest number of children in the country. According to 2011 census data, Uttar Pradesh has 2,97,28,235 (2.97 crore/29.72 million) children aged 0-6 years while Bihar has 1,85,82,229 (1.85 crore/18.5 million).PTIAccording to the RTI response, Maharashtra reported 70,665 SAM children followed by Gujarat at 45,749, Chhattisgarh at 37,249, Odisha at 15,595, Tamil Nadu at 12,489, Jharkhand at 12,059, Andhra Pradesh at 11,201, Telangana at 9,045, Assam at 7,218, Karnataka at 6,899, Kerala at 6,188 and Rajasthan at 5,732.The identification of SAM children was done by over 10 lakh Anganwadi centres from across the country.Ganguly stressed on the role of anganwadi centres in helping improve the nutrition status of the children.""The anganwadis have to become much more functional and if the possibility of children reaching anganwadis is going to become hard because of lockdowns, then the anganwadis need to reach the children. So what are the plans for that?"" she asked.""Malnutrition will be a huge comorbidity... if what they are saying that children will be affected more in the next wave holds true, then malnutrition will be a huge comorbidity and how are they going to address that?""Dola Mohapatra, executive director, Rise Against Hunger India, agreed that COVID-19 could further exacerbate the situation with shrinking food diversity and low intake combined with episodes of missing food at times.He said solutions have to be both home-based care and facility-based care.""Since SAM has direct connection with food availability, utilisation and awareness - the immediate task is to appropriately build linkages with the government systems to ensure families receive not just ration/food, but required education and support,"" he said.""COVID-19 has been a big impediment in organising community based interventions, so new ways/methods to disseminate info to the mothers and caregivers have to be found out,"" he said.Mohapatra also stressed on the need to strengthen Nutrition Rehabilitation Centres (NRCs) which are meant to treat SAM cases""There are studies that suggest that NRCs have not been very effective. In many cases, we have seen that SAM cases have been discharged early because either the centre could not continue to keep the same case for a continued period, or the caregivers could not stay for a longer duration at the facility, or there was simply not enough supervision by the higher ups.""He also stressed on the need for designing customised menus in consultation with experts for SAM cases and formulating guidelines.PTI""For administrative and operational convenience, as well as for better accountability, SAM cases could be segregated into smaller units and responsibility to manage/coordinate and monitor smaller units could be handed over to independent entities such as medical colleges, local NGOs, women's collectives - under the overall guidance of the District/Block health staff,"" Mohapatra said.While data is not updated year on year, the last available figure of SAM children is from NFHS-4 (National Family Health Survey) in 2015-16 according to which prevalence of severe acute malnutrition among children was reported at 7.4 per cent.NFHS-4 gathered information from 601,509 households, 699,686 women, and 112,122 men. Information on 265,653 children below age 5 has been collected in the surveyNFHS-5, released in December last year, which gave figures for 22 states and UTs also presented a grim scenario. It said malnutrition increased among children in 2019-20 from 2015-16 in 22 states and UTs.Around 13 states and UTs out of the 22 surveyed recorded a rise in percentage of children under five years who are stunted in comparison to 2015-16; 12 states and UTs recorded a rise in percentage of children under five years who are wasted; 16 states and UTs recorded a rise in the percentage of children under five years who are severely wasted and underweight in 2019-20. The NFHS-5 was conducted on 6.1 lakh sample households.Wasting is low weight for their height among children, reflecting acute undernutrition. Wasting is a strong predictor of mortality among children under five years of age.To tackle high persistence of malnutrition in the country, the Centre launched the Poshan Abhiyan programme in 2018 to reduce low birth weight, stunting and undernutrition and anaemia among children, adolescent girls and women."

The report was published on Thursday.The coronaviruses gathered 13 mutations to the spike protein, which is known to help the virus escape the immune response, and 19 other mutations that could change the behavior of the virus, said a report by Business Insider.Representational ImageIt is not clear if the mutations she developed were passed on to others.Some of these mutations have been seen in variants of concern, such as:The E484K mutation, which is part of the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7, which was first seen in the UK).The N510Y mutation, which is part of the Beta variant (B.1.351, which was first seen in South Africa).Representational ImageIf more such cases are found, it raises the prospect that HIV infection could be a source of new variants simply because the patients could carry the virus for longer, Tulio de Oliveira, a geneticist at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban and the study's author, told the LA Times."

542037," Crash diets, starvation and unrealistic methods to look a certain way - this is the kind of society that we are a part of. In case you belong to the glamour world then every day is doomsday. Unfortunately, this lifestyle has seeped its way into the minds of commoners as well, courtesy pop culture and social media trends. Theres a constant need to check all the boxes that are deemed right by a certain section of the society.youtubeWhile things are changing and mindsets are evolving at a rapid pace, toxic beauty standards are still practiced. Women have started smashing stereotypes and defying societys standards, but have you ever wondered how men still seem to follow the masculine clichs? The superhero age is largely to be blamed as our fantasies of them show them in the most unrealistic light.A tumblr thread opened a can of worms when commentators called out several movies and TV shows for they perpetuate unrealistic male standards, especially their physicality.People went on to explain why looks arent the only important thing and great bodies dont signify perfect health. Scroll!youtubeDuring the filming of Fight Club in 1999, Brad Pitt was cutting weight for every single scene to maintain his physique at 155 pounds. It is said to be the most horrible process. He did it because they needed a look. Upending their whole life just to show washboard abs on screen for 2-3 hours tops manages to leave some serious repercussions.twitterIn an interview, Changing Tatum had said that his Magic Mike body didnt last for more than five days. He starved down and dehydrated his already fit physique for a look. This is the same movie where he played a stripper in a club and had to do several dance routines topless.twitterCaptain America aka Chris Evans had to wear shirts so small that they would physically hurt. So much so that he dislocated a shoulder during the helicopter scene in Civil War. Superheroes need to look sharp and shredded under those costumes, right?official posterHe went through a 36-hour period of dehydration, which caused him to temporarily lose 10 pounds of water weight.During a fight scene that he was filming, he was at the brink of blacking out the whole time just to look unrealistically muscular. In an interview with Steven Colbert, Hugh had said, If you go three days without water, You will die. Then, when You are halfway there they shout Roll it!screengrabEven for a Greek god-esque man like Chris Hemsworth, Hollywood has no mercy. For the movie Thor, he had to spend several days dehydrating until he lost about a gallon of water weight so that he could finish 2 days of shooting scenes without his shirt after which he had to have recovery time so that he didn't have to be hospitalized because of the stress that he had put his body through.instagram/kumail nanjianiIn an Instagram post, Nanjiani shared that he drove an hour every day to a discreetly located gym in Beverly Hills, and dreaded the whole regimen planned for him during the day. He had been hitting the gym since he was 16 years old, but had not trained for anything as intense as the regimen for Eternals. Aside from heavy weights, complicated machines and many sets of exercises, he admits, there was a phase when electric currents were involved. The early workout days were so brutal on his body that he had come close to vomiting. During those days of extreme discomfort, the actor says he learned to dissociate from his body and its aches.Theres no doubt that many moviemakers are rising above the physicality bit of it and indulging in storylines that are realistic and not focused only on the looks but the bitter truth remains, people who work in the entertainment industry might be cashing in truck loads of money but the constant pressure to look a certain way is always looming on their heads. On the other hand, these unrealistic fads often make the youth follow trends blindly. This vicious cycle needs to end. Period."

The school had made it mandatory for students to wear dark dress shoes and had categorically stated that no athletic shoes were to be allowed.Given the fact that the graduation was about to start, it also meant that Peters did not have the option to leave and go purchase new shoes.According to Peters, the realisation that he would not be allowed into graduation left him humiliated.""

542012," India has opposed the idea of a vaccine passport to make international travel easier amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan who was speaking at a G7 plus ministerial session said that the idea is discriminatory.""At this stage of the pandemic, it is pertinent to also discuss India's concern over the idea of a vaccine passport. Considering the fact of the lower levels of vaccination of the population in developing countries in contrast to the developed countries and given the still-unaddressed issues related to equitable and affordable access, supply and distribution of safe and effective vaccines, India would propose that the implementation of a vaccine passport will be hugely discriminatory and disadvantageous to the developing countries,"" he said.BCCLSeveral countries including the US, UK, the EU etc. have been seriously considering the introduction of a 'vaccine passport' - a document showing the traveler's vaccination history to facilitate international travel without restrictions.While a vaccine passport may not be a big deal for many western countries where a sizable section of the population has been administered both doses of COVID-19 vaccines, it puts countries like India at a disadvantageous position.That is because only less than four per cent of India's adult population have so far received both doses.BCCLIn addition to this, one of the COVID-19 vaccines used in India - Covaxin, is yet to receive emergency use authorization from the WHO, which means that even if someone has taken both shots of the vaccine, it may not be recognized by the country they intend to travel.Recently keeping in mind this requirement, many states in India had announced that those who have to travel abroad for work or studies will be given priority for vaccination.Kerala which has a sizable population working abroad had recently said that those traveling abroad will be issued vaccine certificates with their passport numbers.PTIThe state had also said that such people will be given the Covishield vaccine as it cleared by the WHO (as Oxford AstraZeneca).Karnataka government too has added students and working professionals travelling overseas for employment in the preferential groups for COVID-19 vaccination.""Earlier, vaccination confirmation was not attached with the passport but with the PAN card and Aadhar card. But now, to facilitate the students and employees going abroad it has been linked with passport,"" Deputy Chief Minister Dr C Ashwath Narayan said.BCCLIn Maharashtra, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had launched a similar initiative in Mumbai, a walk-in vaccination -- without registration -- for students going abroad."

Alarmed by the mountains of plastic waste leaching into Indonesia's waters, two best friends are taking on the environmental menace by turning crisp bags and shampoo packets into paving bricks.AFPThe duo kicked start their initiative two years ago visiting food stalls across the capital Jakarta on the hunt for discarded instant coffee sachets, dried noodle packs and shopping bags. Thanks to a viral social media campaign, the friends now receive reams of plastic waste packaging from donors across the country. That rubbish flows in daily and is piled high at the little firm's Jakarta-area factory.""It shows how Indonesians have a strong awareness of recycling plastic waste, but they don't know where to do it,"" 34-year-old Sabrina said. Rebricks staff mulch the packaging into tiny flakes that are then mixed with cement and sand and moulded into building blocks.

542002," One of the biggest, yet unattended consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the rapid increase in the amount of biomedical waste being generated.From face masks that we throw away to the PPE kits used by healthcare workers and samples collected for testing, there has been a huge increase in the amount of biomedical waste in the country.BCCLAccording to a new report by the Centre for Science and Environment, over two lakh kilograms of biomedical waste was generated each day last month by hospitals alone in India.This include cultures, stocks of infectious agents, associated biologicals, human blood and blood products, contaminated sharps, amputated body parts and isolation waste.BCCLAlthough it is a small proportion of the total waste generated (around 1 per cent), it needs special handling due to its highly toxic contents that can pose a severe threat to human health.The State of India's Environment 2021' said 2,03,000 kg of COVID-19 biomedical waste was produced daily in May this year and it was roughly 33 per cent of India's non-COVID biomedical waste.It said the COVID-19 biomedical waste generated per day in May was 46 per cent more than in April when 1.39 lakh kg of such waste was produced daily.BCCLIn March, the daily figure was 75,000 kg, according to the report.April and May witnessed a deadly second wave of coronavirus cases that swept through the country stretching the healthcare infrastructure to its limits.According to the findings, Kerala, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Delhi and Karnataka contributed 50 per cent of COVID-19 biomedical waste generated in May.Under the existing waste disposal rules, biomedical waste is segregated into four categories  Yellow (highly infectious waste such as human, animal, anatomical, soiled), Red (contaminated recyclable waste generated from disposable items like tubing, bottles tubes, syringes), White (waste sharps, including needles, syringes with fixed needles), and Blue (broken or discarded and contaminated glassware, including medicine vials).BCCLConsidered potentially infectious, all Covid waste, irrespective of content, is tagged Yellow and incinerated.The report also said that India still disposes of 12 per cent of its hospital waste without any treatment with Bihar and Karnataka faring the worst.""In 2019, India treated 88 per cent of its biomedical waste, down from 92.8 per cent in 2017,"" the report authored by Kiran Pandey and Rajit Sengupta, said.BCCLWhile this is the waste generated by hospitals there is also an increase in the amount of such waste from homes.A lot of biomedical waste like masks and PPE kits are also being generated in general homes now. So that is becoming a big problem. These things are finding their way across ecosystems,"" Ravi Agarwal, founder director of the environmental NGO Toxics Link, told PTI."
542001," We may have found out the ways to reach Mars, but on Earth we are still grappling with the challenge of managing the tonnes of waste that we humans produce every single day. This waste is so much that it has exceeded the limits of land and is now mixing with the water thats there on the planet. The waste that reaches the sea through the drainage system is the biggest challenge for the world. Perhaps, a small city in Australia has found an answer to it.shareablyHow Quickly Are The Oceans Getting Destroyed?At a speed with which human-made waste is being dumped into the oceans, time is not far when we see the trash coming back to the cities along with the waves. It is believed that every year we throw about 5.25 trillion small pieces of plastic in our ocean.When these apparently small plastic pieces are mixed together, they take a huge form. Single use plastic is being used so much these days that a rough total of several billion plastic bags are produced and used every year. Besides oceans, plastic is responsible for polluting the air as well as affecting our health.National History MuseumAccording to an estimate, nearly 5.6 trillion ciggarets are consumed every year, out of which about 4.6 trillion butts are thrown on land, rivers and sea. They take decades in complete decomposition. These are a very few examples, in reality, the condition of the oceans is much worse.A small city in Australia is doing its bit to save the oceans and set an example for others to follow.How A Small Australian City Began The Initiative To Save The OceansThe city of Kwinana with a population of just 39,000 is famous all over the world today. There are two huge drains in the city. Most of the city's water passes through those drains into the sea. Earlier, it was causing a lot of damage. The real problem was the rain. During the rains, the water used to push the waste from the roads directly into the drains and from there directly through the pipes, carried all that waste to the sea.shareablyIn such a situation, the administration thought that why not put a big net on the two drains that connect with the sea, so that the garbage could be stopped from going into the sea. In March 2018, a trap was placed and the result was seen in just three months. After installing the net, 370 kg of garbage was stopped from going into the sea in such a short time.The waste consisted mainly of food packets, water bottles, plastic pieces, etc. Everyone was surprised to see how much garbage their small town generates in three months. In such a situation, when the method was getting successful, the story was shared on social media.The World Is Surprised To See This MethodThe process of covering the drains with nets and getting the waste recycled cost the city of Kwinana only $20,000. The city administration shared this on Facebook through a post which went viral in no time whatsoever. This post has been liked by more than 25 million people so far. The Kwinana administration is getting calls from places like America, Europe and Africa.boredpandaThis is only because the method is cheap, easy and successful. Now, many countries are taking information from Kwinana about it.Although, everyone knows that this method will not solve the problem of waste forever, but the problems coming through it can be avoided.Hardly anyone would have thought that such a big problem of waste could be solved from a small city. Today everyone is engaged in praising the city of Kwinana. Every city should adopt this method so that we can give a clean earth for the coming generations."
541999," Parts of the Arctic sea ice are thinning up to twice as fast as previously thought, meaning some parts of the region could become ice-free by 2040, according to new research. Among other things, this means that the findings will now raise fresh concerns about global climate change as well as the potential increases in extreme weather and flooding in coastal parts of the world.RedditThe thinning will result in a vicious circle in which more dark water is exposed to the suns heat, leading to even more heating of the planet. The faster ice loss means the shorter north-eastern shipping passage from China to Europe will become easier to navigate, but it also means new oil and gas extraction is more feasible.Robbie Mallett of University College London, who led the study, said: Sea ice thickness is a sensitive indicator of the health of the Arctic  and, when the Arctic warms, the world warms.ReutersThicker ice acts as an insulating blanket, stopping the ocean from warming up the atmosphere in winter and protecting the ocean from the sunshine in summer. Thinner ice is also less likely to survive during the Arctic summer melt.Calculating the thickness of sea ice from satellite radar data is difficult because the amount of snow cover on top varies significantly. Until now, the snow data used came from measurements by Soviet expeditions on ice floes between 1954 and 1991. But the climate crisis has drastically changed the Arctic, meaning this information is out of date.The new research used novel computer models to produce detailed snow cover estimates from 2002 to 2018. The models tracked temperature, snowfall and ice floe movement to assess the accumulation of snow. Using this data to calculate sea ice thickness showed it is thinning twice as fast as previously estimated in the seas around the central Arctic, which make up the bulk of the polar region.ReutersMoreover, sea ice thickness is calculated from satellite radar data that measures how high the ice sits above the sea surface. Snow on top of the ice is invisible to the radar signals but it weighs the ice down, so it is critical to know the depth of snow.The researchers also looked at the impact the changes could have on indigenous communities that live in the northernmost part of the world. ""The thinning of coastal sea ice is also worrying for indigenous communities, as it leaves settlements on the coast increasingly exposed to strong weather and wave action from the emerging ocean,"" Mallett said.Arctic Sea Ice/ReutersThe Arctic, together with the Antarctic, are sometimes known as the world's refrigerator, with white snow and ice in the region reflecting heat back into space, while other parts of the planet continue to absorb heat."

541996," Amid the second wave of Covid-19, Delhi University is mulling fee waivers to university students who have lost their parents to the novel coronavirus infection, officials said. The varsity has written to its colleges to conduct a survey and prepare a list of such students who have lost either one or both their parents to the virus.Delhi University has written to its colleges to conduct a survey of students who have lost their parents due to coronavirus. We have sought a report in the matter by Monday, Dean of Colleges, Balaram Pani told PTI.BCCLAccording to officials, there are three types of colleges under the Delhi University. These are colleges maintained by trusts; those maintained by the varsity; and the colleges fully or partially funded by the Delhi government. There are 28 colleges fully or partially funded by the Delhi government, including 12 that are fully funded by the AAP dispensation.The fee waiver, which will be 100 per cent, will be applicable for students who have lost either of the parents or both to the virus in both the waves of the pandemic. They won't even be charged examination fees.Representational ImageThe principal of one of the DU colleges, requesting anonymity said, that when the VC says they are giving a fee waiver, they can only waive off the university component of the fees. ""There are two components of the fees -- college component and the university component. The college component can only be waived off by the respective college while the university component is very meagre,"" he explained. Some colleges at their level have already started the process.The principal of one of the colleges funded by the Delhi government said, We welcome the initiative. Once the decision is finalised by the varsity, we will put it forth our governing body and get it approved. Since ours is a college funded by the Delhi government and it is a financial matter, we will need to get it approved by the governing body.P C Joshi, acting vice-chancellor of the varsity, underlined that the varsity is actively considering the fee waiver matter. At a prayer meeting held in the memory of varsity employees who lost their lives to the infection, the VC stressed that providing free education to all Delhi University (DU) students who lost their parents in this pandemic till they are studying here is going to be a key area for the administration.BCCLManoj Sinha, the principal of Aryabhaytta College, said they will honour the decision of the varsity.

541993," Around the world, there is a growing awareness about the need to phase out non-renewable energy and switch to more 'green' and renewable power sources.Climate change, global warming and the rapid depletion of fossil fuel reserves are making this push even stronger.While this is happening, a new report has claimed that coal producers are pushing for a 2.2 billion tonnes per annum of new mine projects around the world.BCCLAccording to a report from Global Energy Monitor, this is a growth of 30 per cent from current production levels and will boost supply to over four times the 1.5 degrees Celsius-compliant pathway necessary to meet the goal of the Paris climate agreement.The first-of-its-kind analysis surveyed 432 proposed coal projects globally and found a handful of provinces and states in China, Russia, India, and Australia are responsible for 77 per cent (1.7 billion tonnes per annum) of new mine activity.BCCLAccording to the report, coal producers' expansion plans are at odds with the IEA's net-zero roadmap, which requires no new coal mines or coal mine extensions, as well as the UN and leading research organisations, which have found coal production needs to decline 11 per cent each year through 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.While three-fourths (1.6 billion tonnes per annum) of proposed coal mine capacity is in the early stages of planning and thus vulnerable to cancellation, the report finds one quarter (0.6 billion tonnes per annum) of proposed mine capacity is already under construction.India's single largest project, the Siarmal Open Cast mine in Sundergarh district in Odisha could produce 50 mtpa at peak capacity, with an operational life of 38 years, making it the second largest proposed coal mine in the world after Australia's Carmichael Project (60 mtpa).AFPThe state-owned enterprise, Coal India Ltd, accounts for 66 per cent (250 mtpa) of the proposed coal mine pipeline. From the remaining coal mines pipeline, non-CIL state-owned enterprises account for an additional 59 mtpa.India's central and state government collectively account for more than 82 per cent of the proposed coal mines.India has for long intended to increase its domestic coal production to reduce coal imports. However, several attempts to privatisation have resulted in charges of corruption or not enough interest in coal mine auctions.BCCLWith the pandemic induced economic slowdown, the government opened up its coal mining sector to domestic and international companies. In June last year, from 186 mtpa of productive capacity put up for sale, only one quarter (51 mtpa) was allocated, and none of it to foreign buyers.Undeterred, the government launched the second auction in March this year adding another 67 coal blocks on the auction that is likely to take place from June to July this year.This is despite India's promise to phase out non-renewable energy and being one of the leading producers of energy from non-conventional sources like sun and wind."

Later, his family managed to get a bed at a private hospital after investing huge amount of money, but Nimje couldn't be saved despite the best efforts, according to a report in Times of India.Reuters (Representational Image)It is believed that Nimje contracted COVID when he went for the first dose of the vaccine with his wife. After his condition deteriorated, his friend Ratudi and family members started searching for medicines and a bed.When the family admitted Nimje to a hospital in Ramdespeth, the family was asked to arrange Tocilizumab that cost around Rs 45,000. However, it was only available in the black market for Rs 1.45 lakh. A volunteer, who knew Nimje, sent four vials of the injection from Delhi by flight. However, his condition deteriorated and he passed away on May 26.BCCLChandan, whose sons also died of Covid, was associated with a group of volunteers who helped cremate bodies of COVID victims in the last one-and-a-half year. Nimje had retired as secretary-level officer in the central government. His family had to go through great difficulty while arranging for a bed and Tociclizumab injection. Now, as the family has spent all its savings, they stare at penury.Arvind Ratudi, who worked closely with Chandan, said, ""We approached everyone, not only for financial help, but also for a bed and medicines, but none responded. We approached Nagpur Municipal Corporation commissioner, collector and other top officials, but no one helped the person who went out of the way to provide dignity in death to over 1,300 citizens.""PTI""If we, with our thousands of activists, failed to get timely help for the old man, imagine the plight of common citizens due to such attitude of authorities,"" said Ratudi."

541956," A herd of elephants that packed its trunks for an unexpected 500km (300 mile) trek has arrived at a Chinese city where millions of people live. The 15 elephants have been hoovering up crops and poking their noses through doors on the march from the south of Yunnan province to its capital Kunming.A big effort - with tonnes of food - is under way to try and keep them safe. It is unclear why they left their habitat to embark on the journey, which has captivated residents and experts. It also highlights the rapidly shrinking forest habitats in the country as a result of development.ReutersMaybe theyre looking for better food. Maybe theyve gotten lost. Maybe theyre just adventurous and having a good time. No one is quite sure. Some have suggested an inexperienced leader may have led the herd astray, while other believe the elephants could be searching for a new habitat.The journey appears to have begun in March 2020, when 16 elephants were seen moving from the nature reserve northward toward the city of Puer, in southern Yunnan province, according to state media. But movement is normal for elephants, which have large home ranges over which they travel searching for food.So it was not until relatively recently that researchers and government officials began to notice just how far this herd had wandered.BBCIn April, the elephants were spotted around Yuanjiang County, about 230 miles north of the nature reserve. By then, a few elephants had turned around, while others had been born, according to officials. The group now consists of 15 animals.CCTV footage of the 15 elephants, including three calves, has been aired on television and shared on social media showing the herd stomping through the streets of Yunnan province. Their journey north has been monitored by millions of people online.Hu Chao/Xinhua via APThe Asian elephants have travelled more than 400km (248 miles) from their usual range on the border with Myanmar, and are now outside the provincial capital of Kunming, a city of about eight million people. Scientists say this is the furthest any of the wild elephants there have travelled from the habitat.The Kunming Daily says the cities of Kunming and Yuxi deployed almost 700 police and emergency workers armed with 10 tonnes of corn, pineapples and other food. They were backed up by trucks and drones to try to divert the animals on to a safe path.Don't gawk or leave corn or salt out; keep your distance and don't disturb them with firecrackers, residents have been told.APAnimal experts say the herd appears to have gathered pace, possibly because the heavier human population has increased its fears, and it is unlikely the elephants would try to enter Kunming. Efforts to turn them around have failed, and scientists may have to try and find them a suitable place to live nearby."

Moreover, the Model Tenancy Act would also help in overhauling the legal framework with respect to rental housing across the country, the Centre said in a statement.A digital platform will be set up in the local vernacular language or the language of the State/Union Territory for submitting tenancy agreement and other documents. Rent Authority will keep a tab on these agreements.afpStates, which will be free to adopt the law owing to land being state subject, will be required to constitute rent courts and rent tribunal, it stated.After enforcement of this Act, no person can let or take on rent any premises except by an agreement in writing. Repeal of local rent control Acts has been a politically sensitive issue in cities with high-value rent markets, such as especially South Mumbai, where old properties in prime locations have been occupied for decades by tenants at negligible rent.Subletting of premises can only be done with the prior consent of the landlord, and no structural change can be done by the tenant without the written consent of the landlord.According to the MTA Act, a landowner cannot cut power and water supply in case of a dispute with the tenant. It also stated that a landowner cannot enter the rented premises without 24-hour prior notice to carry out repairs or replacement.The Act lists the kinds of repairs each party would be responsible for, with the provision that money for repairs can be deducted from the security deposit or rent, as applicable, if a party refuses to carry out their share of the work.istockThe Rent Court can allow repossession by the landlord if the tenant misuses the premises, after being served a notice by the landowner. Misuse of the premises, as defined, includes public nuisance, damage, or its use for immoral or illegal purposes. If the tenant refuses to vacate, the landlord can claim double the monthly rent for two months, and four times the monthly rent thereafter."
541948," We know dogs as mans best friend. However, it seems like dogs have been wired to be humans friend from the moment they take birth.SWNSAlso Read: Researchers Find New Coronavirus That Comes From Dogs: What Do We Know So FarThis is according to a new study by researchers at the University of Arizona who found that puppies were born with human-like social skills that allowed them to communicate with humans from a very early age instead of learning later in life.For this study, they analysed 98 Labrador retrievers, 23 golden retrievers and 254 labrador golden crosses from 117 litters. Each one of them originated from a similar rearing history and pedigree going back several generations.They conducted a series of tests, looking at interactions between puppies and humans. One of the tests had the pups look for a hidden treat beneath one of the two overturned cups, after being pointed at by the researcher.The pups would do this even after the odour was masked, limiting the pups to not rely on just their noses.In another task, researchers started to talk to the puppies in a high-pitched voice, also known as dog-directed speech and looked at how long the puppy looked at the humans.Also Read: Women Played A Big Role In Evolution Of Dogs And Cementing Our FriendshipAlmost all dogs were successful in at least one of the tasks, showcasing their skills from the very beginning. In control tests, when they were not directed, puppies did not rely on the people or look at them for suggestions, indicating that even though puppies may know how to respond to human-initiated communication from the moment theyre born, the ability to think and execute decisions on their own might take time to develop.SWNSAlso Read: Just Like Us, Teenage Is Tough For Dogs And They Need Help And Understanding, Claims StudyDr Bray, one of the lead researchers of the study said, We show that puppies will reciprocate human social gaze and successfully use the information given by a human in a social context from a very young age and prior to extensive experience with humans. For example, even before puppies have left their littermates to live one-on-one with their volunteer raisers, most of them are able to find hidden food by following a human point to the indicated location.She added, All these findings suggest that dogs are biologically prepared for communication with humans. From a young age, dogs display human-like social skills, which have a strong genetic component, meaning these abilities have a strong potential to undergo selection. Our findings might therefore point to an important piece of the domestication story, in that animals with a propensity for communication with our own species might have been selected in the wolf populations that gave rise to dogs."

Well, this just came true last year, along with 100 other musicians jamming live from different corners of the world, giving an up-close-and-personal experience from their living rooms.Interestingly, the Rolling Stones even managed to play together from four separate locations at the same time. Now, that is a great example of paving the way for the digital evolution of the entertainment industry.Getty ImagesIt was spectacular to see the seamless broadcasting and cloud-based live editing, which brought together worldwide talent on one virtual stage.

In fact, we are observing an incredible rise in the daily consumption of video content across age groups from 40 to 50 mins a day to nearly 190 mins a day.Live sports capture a big share of the entertainment industry. It is not mere entertainment but a part of life and passion for people. Therefore, it has been one industry that has been forced to evolve digitally at the pace of its fans digital adoption, interests, and changing habits.IPLThe increasing demand to witness the on-field bustle and for fans to cheer their favourite players like they are right next to them in the game has pushed the industry to progress to immersive, virtually augmented, and remotely produced form of entertainment.The sporting federations that were not prepared for the year 2020 and had to ramp up technology upgrades and infrastructure in a matter of weeks and months; which an earlier estimate had indicated a few years down the line.Getty ImagesHistorically, live events have been resource-intensive with hundreds of people such as engineers, editors, producers, and more required at the venue with a fleet of OB (Outside Broadcasting) vans to process the feeds captured from multiple cameras and share it with broadcasters with a lag of few minutes.The introduction of remote production technology now allows broadcasters to just send the cameras on the match location, with the production team back in office, working remotely, to analyse the feeds received from multiple locations and broadcast customised feeds in real-time, cutting down on the latency and the humongous cost.Remote production is not a new concept, but in just last year, it became the unbeatable heroic technology to rescue sporting events, broadcasters, marketers, and the desperate fans worldwide by setting the field for the players with minimum contact and a skeleton crew on-ground.Indian Premier League, is one of the most successful case studies of remote production getting cloudified. It surely brightened every Indian cricket fans day with superior video quality resolution, real-time delivery in nine different languages with cutting edge, ultra-low latency solution.By virtualising the entire environment and using media orchestration on the cloud, teams could create cloud-based content workflows that aided content creators and stakeholders to manage the video production chain end-to-end remotely from their homes.IPLAnother remote production miracle that broke traditional and geographic inhibitions, was the warm-welcome given to NC Dinos and Samsung Lions of South Korea by American baseball fans, watching the league in English commentary past their bedtime.Certainly, a cue for the sports fraternity and digital media companies to expand their footprints globally due to the growing demand for regional programming in non-native geographies.The quest for original sports content has led to the proliferation of esports and cloud gaming for action-hungry fans across the world, especially India. It is heartening to see that Indian gamers today constitute for 15% of the global gamer community.Envato // Representative pic of a girl gaming on her PCThis is a testament of the digital penetration in the country, replicating the change in consumer perception towards sport and gaming. It further draws attention on the need for bridging the fan experience gaps through a platform that is unimaginably interactive, engaging, and real-time.Although the gaming industry has started strengthening the roots in the country, it still needs the right monetisation and publishing support. Seamless user experience and additional unique content outside the game are going to be crucial factors for promoting and building the community.Migrating to the cloud is the top priority of an industry that has immense possibilities. As it enables remote teams to integrate and automate their usual tasks such as file delivery, frame-accurate editing, transcoding videos for OTT platforms, seamlessly in virtual environments  without having to transfer feeds between physical workstations.UnsplashThe movement to UHD, 4K, 360 degree VR, and other rich formats has commenced, leading to a dire need for fibre-based video networks for uncompressed video contribution.

The facilities, which will also have intensive-care units (ICUs), will be ready by next month, well before experts predict the third wave will hit, said Chahal.ReutersApart from these units, the government is also in talks with hospitals to increase the number of paediatric beds and ICUs. The paediatric task force, led by Dr Suhas Prabhu, plans to train about 660 paediatricians on how to handle children affected by COVID-19, and then broaden the training to more staff. The third wave might not end up affecting children greatly, but cities like Mumbai cannot afford to be caught off guard, Prabhu said.BMCs first genome sequencing laboratory will come up at Kasturba Hospital later this month to help find variants of concern in Covid-positive samples at the earliest and implement public health measures.BCCL/ We will have our genomic laboratory ready later this month and we are in the process of tying up with management institutes to analyse past Covid trends in the city to arrive at answers, BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani told The Times of India.Like other cities, Mumbai is also in a race against time to get the maximum number of people vaccinated against COVID-19 before the third wave. As the shortage of vaccines continues, BMC on its own is trying to procure the doses from the international market."

541921," The standoff between Amul and People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has escalated as both sides are exchanging barbs and engaging in open mudslinging.On Tuesday, Valamji Humbal, the Vice Chairman of Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), which sells Amul-branded dairy products, wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to ban PETA.BCCLHumbal alleged that the non-governmental organisation in cohorts with foreign companies is involved in a larger conspiracy to malign the image of the dairy industry. He went as far as to call the NGO an opportunistic element spreading misinformation.In turn, PETA Indias CEO and veterinarian Dr Manilal Valliyate was quick to respond and called Amul a bully, unable to appreciate the publics concerns for animals.Though the recent confrontation between the two was triggered by an advertisement by Amul, it all started when the countrys largest dairy brand objected to companies labelling plant-based beverages as milk.TwitterLets take a look at how the tussle began and how it escalated into a fierce conflict.November 2020Amul has been on a mission since last year to disallow the use of the term milk. The dairy cooperative society slammed companies selling almond, soya, rice beverages and oats in disguise of milk and said that it may consider dragging them to court to stop this practice.Food regulator, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) had issued a draft notification in August, proposing to stop the use of the word 'milk' for such products. Amul has been known to object to labels of several other product segments such as vanaspati ghee and ice cream in the past too.AMulMarch 2021FSSAI had initially indicated a timeline of a month or two to make a decision. However, the delay seemingly made Amul and the larger dairy industry antsy. To fight what it calls a spread of misinformation, the dairy brand in March rolled out advertisements in newspapers and on social media talking about the difference between milk and plant-based beverages.The advertisements claimed to bust myths such as plant-based beverages are rich in nutrients, plant-based beverages are milk and plant-based beverages are a sustainable food system etc. It went to talk about the fact that milk is a complete food, natural as well as vegetarian.The ad mentioned that dairy alone contributes Rs 8 lakh crore to the Indian economy. In comparison, value of the vegan or plant based milk industry in India would not exceed a few hundred crore rupees at the moment. Its more like Goliath versus a speck of dust.AMulThe campaign piqued NGOs such as PETA, Beauty Without Cruelty (BWC), and Sharan India and they complained to the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI).May 2021ASCI, which is a self-regulatory voluntary organisation of the advertising industry, upheld the contentions of AMUL and observed that there is sufficient scientific data to prove that milk is nutritious and a rich source of calcium, vitamins, carbohydrates, fat, minerals and protein.TwitterEnd of MayDisgruntled with the ASCI verdict, PETA, wrote a letter to Amul in late May, asking the dairy cooperative society to switch to making vegan products. ""We would again like to encourage Amul to benefit from the booming vegan food and milk market, instead of wasting resources trying to fight the demand for plant-based products that are only growing. Other companies are responding to market changes, and Amul can too,"" PETA India said in a letter addressed to the MD RS Sodhi.HOBThis sparked a Twitter war between the two. R.S Sodhi questioned the NGO if they would give livelihood to 100 million dairy farmers.... Who will pay for the school fee.... How many can afford expensive lab manufactured factory-made food out of chemicals and synthetic vitamins..... Since then, both sides have waged an ugly war of words which subsequently resulted in the letter to the PM."

541915," Until last year, if we had to share digital versions of our documents online, most of us would rely on an app named CamScanner that used our phone cameras to capture images of those docs and frame it in a way that would make it appear as if they were put in a real scanner.ALSO READ: Chinese Banned Apps Alternatives in India: TikTok, UC Browser, CamScanner, ShareIT And VaultKaagaz ScannerBut due to looming security concerns, CamScanner was pulled down from the app stores in India. However, one app named Kaagaz, made by Indian software engineers, ha tried to bridge this gap and it did so with several unique features making it one of the most downloaded apps on Google Play Store and Apples App Store.Kaagaz Scanner was created by Snehanshu Gandhi, Gaurav Shrishrimal and Tamanjit Bindra. Today, the app has seen over one million downloads. We got a chance to interact with Snehanshu to learn more about their journey while creating this app.Snehanshu shared how until June last year, they had been working on a complex productivity app dubbed Sorted AI, which had been in development for almost a year.However, when they saw a massive spike in Indian users looking for basic tools to start their digital life, they decided to shift their focus, Over 500 million users have come to the internet and to digital life in the last few years through their smartphones. All these users have leapfrogged the desktop generation and are mobile-only users.He added, They are looking for tools that are built for them, while the market today offers them global products that were built for desktop (& adapted to mobile) & built for the first-generation internet users. Hence, we decided to focus on that and built Kaagaz with a vision of building mobile-first productivity tools for the Bharat users to become part of the mainstream digital economy.Play StoreSnehanshu revealed how their app got a chance to shine after the Government of India pulled CamScanner out of the app stores in the country, We had launched Kaagaz on Play Store on 12th Jun20 and 2 weeks later the Government of India put a ban on a few Chinese apps. This ban led to a huge surge in users looking for an Indian scanning app.He added, Kaagaz being obviously Indian due to its name started getting a lot of traction overnight and within 24 hrs we had gone from practically zero downloads to 100,000 downloads. The next 10 days were crazy with lots of sleepless nights, at the same time very exciting with the hyper growth.Snehanshu shared how Kaagaz Scanner stands out from the rest of the bunch, One of the key differentiators of Kaagaz, as compared to other products, is the simplicity of its user interface & user experience. Kaagaz has no ads & no watermark which makes it is a preferred product for the users.He added, By default, Kaagaz is an offline app and doesnt require any login. This makes it very easy to use at the same time it makes it highly secure since Kaagaz doesnt take the users documents to the cloud. Users have complete control over the security of their documents as the documents are stored on their phone itself. As we offer Cloud storage also, users can decide to back up their documents on the cloud too. In this case, the documents are stored completely encrypted on highly secure servers in India making sure that the documents are safe.Snehanshu shared his experience on crafting a solution for Indian users, Building an India-centric solution requires a conscious effort to understand the Bharat users. It becomes even more important because most of the people developing the products are not Bharat users themselves. Hence, user feedback, user interactions & analysing user behaviour become very important to build the right solutions.He added, Another important aspect is to understand that the users are not well versed with the design language that is commonly used in a lot of products. For example, a lot of users write a review on Play Store saying they like the app a lot but rate it 1 star instead of 5 star. On further interaction with them we realized that they thought they were giving 1st rank to our app because they liked it. This is just an example of how building an India-centric solution requires a deeper user behaviour study & a lot of hand-holding for the users.PlayStoreSnehanshu revealed that the ability to build an easy-to-use app for smartphones that is helping millions of people be part of a digital ecosystem is their biggest motivation.He shared how positive it makes them feel when they see people from a small village or town use Kaagaz and ease their life, The biggest satisfaction comes when a user sitting in some small town/village of the country tells us how Kaagaz helped them in doing an activity which they didnt know how to do or were finding it difficult to do otherwise.When asked what they would have done differently, if they got to do it all over again, Snehanshu says theyd not like to change anything about their journey, Building a product or a company is a journey of how an idea evolves & takes shape over time and this is dependent on the decisions that we take during that journey. We believe that whatever we have achieved has turned out the way it has because of the decisions we took on the way, hence at this point we would not like to change anything."

However, sometime later, someone again started singing, yet another song starring Chawla, resulting in the removal of the person from the hearing.However, the person perhaps managed to enter the meeting once again and this time, Justice directed that the person be identified and issued a contempt notice.As seen from the videos going viral on social media, the platform thats being used is Cisco Webex -- a zoom-like video conferencing app. Ideally, people only who have the link to a meeting can be a part of it. But a bunch of things went wrong for this occurrence to happen.Cisco WebexThe Delhi High Court website that lists all the cases and hearings is public and anyone can access it. The links for the meeting are next to the case hearing details, ever since courts have gone online, during the pandemic.However, not many would go ahead and look for it. But it got amplified after Juhi Chawla made the link to the hearing accessible to everyone via her Twitter and Instagram. Moreover, she urged fans to join the hearing and support her cause.

I spoke to a lawyer from the Bombay High Court who stated that theres an individual from the high court who acts as a gatekeeper allowing people who have a business being a part of their hearing.However, it seems as if this time either the person chose to allow everyone, considering the public nature of the hearing or maybe the person mistakenly allowed someone who wasnt supposed to be there, resulting in the nuisance.Heres where things get tricky. Much like Zoom and some other video conferencing apps, Cisco Webex allows guest logins -- basically, individuals can join a meeting by simply entering their name and email ID and not really going through a registration process.This means, anyone can enter any name or email address to join a meeting. This could also be the reason why the person was able to join again even after being removed from the hearing.While many might be finding this funny, it is also important to note that not only is it disrespectful towards someone who is trying to seek justice in the court of law, this is also a gross disrespect of the decorum of the court.In case youre a host who conducts meetings on a regular basis using CiscoWebex or other platforms, instances like this can sound equally alarming for you.In case youre a Webex user, you can add another layer of security by eliminating guest logins and making sure people who join the meeting must be required to log in to the account. You can set this up by heading to select Services and go to Meetings and then go to Sites. Now, look for an option that says Configure Site.Look for Common Settings and then select Security and look for an opinion Require login before site access.Additionally, look for Security Options under the Cisco Webex section and enable Require users to have an account when joining a phone in both Webex Meetings and Webex Training.

Officials are getting ready with more beds, equipment, and awareness drives to fight the spread.Chief secretary Somesh Kumar had a series of meetings with doctors and experts on the possible third wave and increase of cases among children. Plans are being laid to make at least 5,000 beds available for children.There is also a thought process in the government that there will be more MIS-C cases (Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome) among children, even from July, a top official from the health department told TOI.PTIMore MIS-C cases among children below 10 are being seen now, with 9,858 cases reported during the second wave as against 6,250 cases in the first wave.When contacted, the director of medical education (DME) K Ramesh Reddy said they are confident of tackling the situation when it comes to the below 10 years age group.During the first wave we saw about 1,000 children with MIS-C getting admitted in the Gandhi Hospital but now there are only 500 such cases, none of them has been serious, he said.But he added that MIS-C among kids is a concern, as there is always a fear of more cases surfacing in the future.TOIWe are gearing up to face more cases and Niloufer and Gandhi Hospital will be nodal centres with1,500 beds in Niloufer hospital alone, Reddy said.According to Dr Subodh Kanthmuthan, director at the Centre for Healthcare Management in Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI), the more number of cases during the second wave in children is a result of adults roaming the streets without taking enough precautions.More than medical reasons, the curbs that were observed during the first wave and last year lockdown are missing this year, and adults are moving around and in turn infecting children at home, he added."
541857," The Serum Institute of India, (SII) the Pune-based manufacturer of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine which is marketed in India as Covishield has reportedly sought protection against liabilities over any adverse effects from the vaccine.The development came after reports that the government is discussing possible legal protection to foreign vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna over their COVID-19 jabs in India.AFPIf foreign vaccine makers are given indemnity protection, then all vaccine firms in the country, not just the SII, must be given the same. We are hoping the same rules apply to everyone,"" an SII source told ANI.Earlier, Pfizer which agreed to start supply COVID-19 vaccines to India as early as July had sought an indemnity bond that will exempt it from legal claims in case there are any adverse effects from the vaccine.FileAnother COVID-19 vaccine maker Moderna, which is still in the early stage of negotiations has also sought similar protection against liabilities from the Indian government.SII CEO Adar Poonawala had last year advocated for indemnity for all vaccine manufacturers.""We need to have the government indemnify manufacturers, especially vaccine manufacturers, against all lawsuits... Frivolous claims come up and you see in the media something being blown out of proportion. The government needs to step in with the right messaging,"" he had said.NITI Aayog Member (Health) Dr VK Paul had said on May 27 that the government is still examining the American pharma company's request for indemnity.BCCL""We are examining this request and will make a decision in the larger interest of people and on merit. This is under discussion and there is no decision as of now,"" he had said.No company in India's vaccination history has ever paid indemnity and the government, which is the biggest user of vaccines, has also not done it, Dr Nirmal K Ganguly, former ICMR chief had said on Wednesday.In fact liability protection has been a major issue for foreign vaccine makers to supply the doses to India.AFPEarlier, when states were trying to import COVID-19 vaccines on their own, Pfizer, Moderna refused to sell Covid vaccines directly to them as the companies said they will only deal with the central government.Along with the payment, liability protection was one the reasons for this decision as states can't guarantee this.Recently, a man from Lucknow had filed a case against SII alleging that no antibodies were formed in his body after receiving the first dose of Covishield.AFPThe complainant, Pratap Chandra, stated that after listening to a press briefing of ICMR where it was mentioned that antibodies in sufficient quantities are formed in the body against the virus after taking the first dose, he got an antibody test to determine the level of antibodies formed in his body.Chandra was administered the first dose on April 8 and got the test done on May 25.While this was a one-off case, in the early stages of clinical trials there was a more serious incident.In November 2020, a Chennai man who was a participant in the Covishield vaccine trials had sought Rs. 5 crore compensation for allegedly suffering from serious 'neurological' side-effects after taking the experimental doses."

541837," Less than a week back, Brentford created history by winning the Championship play-off vs Swansea. The win meant they were in the Premier League for the first time since 1947 and that is big. While a lot of credit goes to the players and staff, one man managing everything from behind the scenes is their owner Matthew Benham.There is an interesting history between the club and Benham and for that, we have to turn back the clock. Benham graduated from the University of Oxford in 1989 with a degree in Physics. For the next 12 years, he worked in the financial circuit and was ultimately named Vice-President at the Bank of America.At The MatchBut in 2001, Benham decided to take a different path. He joined Premier Bet, a sports gambling company. In 2003 he left after a falling out with his mentor Tony Bloom. A year later he set up his own betting syndicate  Smartodds. He became a successful sports gambler.So how is this related to Brentford? Wait for it. Benham was a fan of Brentford since watching his first game at the age of 11. In 2007, when the club was facing financial issues, he lent them $700,000. This was given to the fans to buy the club. The catch was if the fans opted not to pay the loan back, he could buy the club. In 2012, the fans did not pay it back and Benham owned the club he idolised as a kid.Using his analytical concepts, he made the team change strategy and made it a more effective unit. His efforts finally bore fruit when the club made it to the Premier League after 74 years.AFPThe decision to hire young talented players instead of top stars paid dividends. Right now the club is worth $300 million. If they remain in the top tier for a 2nd year they will make $400 million.A journey that started all those years ago has come full circle. Well, almost as there's a long way to go. But the story is the stuff movie plots are made of. Only in real life, it sounds even more incredible."

541834," Taking note of the prevailing vaccine shortage in the country even when the infrastructure is available to scale up the production in India, the Delhi High Court said that officers sitting over such untapped potential need to be charged with manslaughter as it is leading to so many deaths.The court said some urgent hand-holding is required for manufacturing vaccines which is missing because of ""fear psychosis"" and this potential should not be taken away by foreigners.BCCLThe problem is of fear psychosis that some vigilance enquiry will take place, audit will take place, police investigation will take place. Tell them, this is not the time to be wary of these investigations and audit reports. This is leading to deaths today. Actually some people need to be charged with manslaughter for sitting over this untapped potential, a bench of Justices Manmohan and Najmi Waziri said.The court said the Centre should expedite the process of clearing samples of Panacea Biotec which has collaborated with Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) for manufacturing Sputnik V here.If the vaccine has been approved for administering to the public at large, then the government is only required to see that the samples being produced by this firm are in conformity with the existing standards, it added.APWhy you want them to go through a bridge trial, if you have made the bridge trial for the imported vaccine.The bridge trial should have been conducted even with regard to the imported vaccine. You have done away with it for the imported vaccine. Why insist it for the domestic manufacturer but not for the manufacturer abroad, the bench asked.This comes even as there is a growing call to allow other vaccine makers in India to manufacture Covaxin, which was co-developed by ICMR.BCCLThe government which is racing against time to vaccinate the maximum number of people before the third wave had recently said that it is open to sharing the formula with more drugmakers.In a related development, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the Centre to hand over premises of HLL Biotech facility near Chennai to Tamil Nadu government on lease for production of COVID-19 vaccines.The plea submitted that to increase domestic production of the vaccines the government has to utilise the unused Public sector units particularly, HLL Biotech Limited (HBL) which is a 100 per cent subsidiary of HLL Lifecare Limited, a Government of India (GOI) Enterprise under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.ReutersIncidentally, this is the second time recently a court in India has made a similar observation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.In April, the Madras High Court had observed that the Election Commission was responsible for the rapid spread of the second wave of COVID-19, called it the ""the most irresponsible institution"" and even said its officials may be booked under murder charges."

Normally this protein phases out as a person gets older, however, researchers have found a way to increase the supply of SIRT6, boosting life expectancy by 250 along the way.The study (which is published in the journal Nature Communications) showed that this boost also made the mice less prone to cancer than before.Prof. Haim Cohen of Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan said in a statement to the Times of Israel, The change in life expectancy is significant when you consider that an equivalent jump in human life expectancy would have us living on average until almost 120. The changes we saw in mice may be translatable to humans, and if so that would be exciting.Cohen, in 2012, became the first researcher who was successful in spiking protein levels in animals and boosting life expectancy, allowing male mice to live 15 percent longer. However, the initial method didnt have any impact on female mice. The recent study, however, impacts both male and female mice.Also Read: Wine And Cheese Reduce Risk Of Alzheimers, Other Age-Related Brain DiseasesHowever, now, the expectancy in male also has risen to 30 percent whereas females are at 15 percent higher expectancy.Getty ImagesAlso Read: This Guy Says Ageing Is A Disease That Can Be Cured, We Can Stop Growing OldScientists saw that ageing mice lost their ability to generate energy due to difficulty in sourcing energy from lactic acid and fats. However, older mice with SIRT6 didnt face such issues. They also had less cholesterol and were more active too.Cohen added, This discovery shows that SIRT6 controls the rate of healthy ageing, and this shows that boosting its activity could potentially slow ageing. We are developing small molecules that may increase the levels of SIRT6, or make existing amounts of the protein more active. They may be used in the future to address ageing."
541825," This World Environment Day, researchers at the Center for Biological Diversity, Friends of the Earth and the University of Maryland ask EPA to create stringent norms on the use of pesticides and germicides to safeguard biodiversity in the soil.Getty ImagesAlso Read: Amazon Rainforest Is Dying From Rising Mercury Levels In Soil Due To Excess MiningIt is no secret that a scoopful of soil consists of more living organisms than people on our planet. These organisms -- like invertebrates, nematodes, bacteria to name a few -- are constantly filtering water, recycling soil nutrients and helping in regulating the planets temperature.However, toxic insecticides, herbicides and fungicides are destroying these microhabitats, drastically affecting soil health, even with these chemicals made from approved pesticide ingredients in the US.This is according to a study in the journal Frontiers in Environmental Science. For their analysis, the researchers looked at nearly 400 published studies that conducted over 2,800 experiments showing how pesticides affect soil organisms.The study looked at 275 unique species/ types of soil organisms as well as 284 different kinds of pesticides.They found that over 70 percent of those experiments pesticides were harming those organisms which were critical to maintaining optimum soil health. Surprisingly, these harms were never considered or categorised in the EPA safety reviews.Also Read: Soil Scientist, World Food Award Winner Dr Rattan Lal To Get Padma Shri AwardThe rise in pesticide-intensive agriculture and pollution are two of the major contributors to bringing down several soil organisms like ground-nesting bees and beetles. The researchers highlight that theyre in fact some of the most crucial drivers of soil biodiversity loss in the previous decade.ReutersResearchers Nathan Donley and Tara Gunstone said in Scientific American, The EPA, which is responsible for pesticide oversight in the U.S., openly acknowledges that somewhere between 50 percent to 100 percent of all agriculturally applied pesticides end up on the soil. Yet to assess pesticides harms to soil species, the agency still uses a single test speciesone that spends its entire life above ground in artificial boxes to estimate the risk to all soil organismsthe European honeybee.Also Read: Delhi Startup Creates AI-Powered Smart Garden Tech To Grow Plants Without SoilThey added, The fact that the EPA relies on a species that literally may never touch soil in its entire life to represent the thousands of species that live or develop underground offers a disturbing glimpse of how the U.S. pesticide regulatory system is set up to protect the pesticide industry instead of species and their ecosystems.Researchers ask EPA to take aggressive steps to save the biodiverse ecosystems in the soil, warning that the long-term environmental cost of this negligence cannot be ignored and that protecting them should be a priority not an afterthought."
541824," Typically, weve always heard stories of men being unfaithful in a relationship, boys dumping the girl because he feels the need to move on which sees women resorting to gutsy haircuts, crazy stalking sessions, sappy statuses and sleepovers to get over their supposed prince charming. But somehow, when a girl cheats on her guy, we expect men to simply move on, because theyre supposed to be more macho, maybe even nonchalant about it.No one seems to get how messy it could become for men as well  low self-esteem, losing sense of reality, slipping into a shell, inflicting yourself with self-pain and brooding over lost love are all definitive traits of the heartbroken aashiq.MX Players latest show Indori Ishq explores all these angles of unrequited love, its ever changing rules, and much more.Our protagonist Kunal (played by Ritvik Sahore) is a happy-go-lucky man who seems to have it all - he has secured a top seat in a Naval College, his parents are incredibly proud of him, and he is in a relationship with the woman of his dreams.MX PlayerBut not for too long - Kunals life hits rock bottom when his girlfriend Tara (played by Vedika Bhandari) cheats on him with another guy. Hes distraught, grieving and spirals into a world of insanity.However, he is ridiculed for ruining his life over a girl and is expected to plunge out of his sorrow in a heartbeat. But does love really work like that?MX PlayerSpeaking about the same, Ritvik Sahore said, My character Kunal is ridiculed for ruining his life over Tara, who has been unfaithful to him. But had the tables been turned - the world would have berated him for ruining a girls life. I believe that in a relationship, there are two equal halves who need to make it work and the blame or the responsibility should be equally distributed.We totally agree with him! The rules of commitment and being faithful in a relationship are so very drastically different for both sexes - and thats something that needs to change.The 9-episodic series also stars Aashay Kulkarni, Meera Joshi, Tithi Raaj, Donna Munshi and Dheer Hira in pivotal roles.All 9-episodes of Indori Ishq are slated to release on 10th June, 2021 only on MX Player.

I dont over think about if I deserve this or that. I am happy where I am right now. Thats the first and foremost thing. Also secondly, I know that there will be no second Rajesh Sharma..Adding further he said, I have worked with very big and talented directors, small budget films, big budget films and everyone loves me there and I only want that. I just need love and respect from people and I get that more than 100 percent.""Twitter"" I always believed one should earn respect. Agar aapke paas bahut paisa hai aur na pyaar hai, na izzat toh us paise ka kya karoge aap. At the end of the day what matters is that I have earned good people.Going back down the memory lane, we asked him about the beginning of his journey as an actor,My first film was Khosla Ka Ghosla though it released after 4 years of making. The film was shot in 2002 and got released in 2006. But I was never worried about it. I was doing my theatres in Kolkata and was very happy.TwitterDespite being in the industry for 19 years, people still do not know Rajesh's name. Asking if that pinches him and he says,Yes, it has happened with me. But it has not happened with me only, there was a biggest director called Amjad Khan, people knew him as Gabbar Singh. Mai toh fir bhi bahut chota hu.And whats there in the name, If my name wasnt Rajesh Sharma but Manoj Tiwaia, kya farkh padta hai. Face toh wahi hai na. And for me what is important that people recognise me by my face, no matter whatever my name is.TwitterWe asked Rajesh how he decided to fit in when everything in Bollywood is about looks, body and other aspects and he said, When I thought of acting, I started with theatre. Earlier, muje pe bhi Hindi cinema ka bhoot sawaar tha. Amitabh Bachchan, Vinod Khanna, Vinod Mehra they all were my idols,. But when I started reading Shakespeare and others, this cinema bhoot slowly came.Now for me there is no charm left in cinema, but theatres. I love watching theatres and thats where I realised that there is no hero and heroine in theatre. People praise the one who is talented, thats when I thought that I will become an actor aur hero banne ka sapna chodhe dia. And then I never looked back, and I dont have a regret that I couldnt become a hero or whey dont I have looks like heroes. I wanted to become an actor and I became one.TwitterHaving said that, Rajesh admitted that hes been lucky to get work,""I was lucky in getting work. After Khosla Ka Ghosla, I got NO One Killed Jessica and people were very happy with my work and thats when I thought that I can do something in my life. l slowly started getting good work, people started loving and recognisinI always felt that you dont get work with casting couch or auditions, you always get work with the good work you have done in past. Your work will get you good work. Kabir Khan also called me and gave me work. I never went to him. He was the one who came to me. So yes I have been lucky.TwitterWhen talking about not making it big, he said,I have always been content with what I got. I never sulked and said why I couldnt become Irrfan Khan or Nawazuddin Siddiqui. I am Rajesh Sharma and what I can do, they cant and what they can do I cant. So there is no point on sulking. I never fell for stardom because cinema ka bhoot utar gaya tha muje pe se, so automatically stardom kahi touch hi nahi kar paaya mujhe.TwitterAddressing the nepotism existing in the industry, he said,Nepotism exists and we should accept it. I dont like this word at all. See nepotism is everywhere and thats not wrong. But what is not right that if you want to promote your son do it, but dont stop anyone else from getting good work. Thats wrong. You cannot stop anyone, thats wrong in every way.Also, what I feel is that if you are better no one can stop you.

The court also highlighted the pricing issue of vaccines, asking the Centre to submit a comparison of the prices of vaccines available in India to their international prices.BCCLIt has been said by many critics that in India, the 18-44-year-olds are paying record prices for vaccines. In most nations, vaccines are procured by the governments and distributed to the people at no cost.The Centre was asked to clarify how the  35,000-crore budget for vaccine procurement is being spent. ""If  35,000 crore has been allocated for vaccine, why it cannot be used for vaccinating the 18-44 age group,"" the judges have questioned, asking the Centre to produce the entire data on its vaccine purchase history.Calling the issue of vaccination absolutely crucial the court said, Hence, due to the importance of vaccinating individuals in the 18-44 age group, the policy of the Central Government for conducting free vaccination themselves for groups under the first 2 phases, and replacing it with paid vaccination by the State/UT Governments and private hospitals for the persons between 18-44 years is, prima facie, arbitrary and irrational.india vaccine shortageThe Centre has been asked to provide clarifications on six points -- including preparedness for needs of children in the event of a third wave, number of crematorium workers vaccinated, and a a roadmap of projected availability of vaccines till December 31.The top court, which took up the issue suo motu, also countered the Centre's argument that judiciary must keep off from executive on policies.

541776," Bashar Al Assad has been elected the President of Syria for seven more years after the election results were announced last week. He got more than 95 per cent votes to regain power in a country that has been devastated by a civil war, which the Syrian government claims to have won.Although there are reported efforts being made to bring a change in the constitution of Syria, the overwhelming power that President Assad enjoys doesnt seem to be going anywhere. Nearly half of the 21-year rule by Assad has seen bloodshed in the streets from Aleppo to Idlib. The death and displacement for the Syrians in the current crisis began on March 15, 2011. Many groups beginning from Free Syrian Army, the Shia Militia, the Kurds, the government forces, Iran backed fighters, Saudi backed fighters, Americans and Russians all of them were killing each other while making life a hell for the Syrians.AFPAccording to a report by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), nearly 500,000 people have been killed in the decade-long civil war in Syria since the Syrian revolution began.Also Read: Heart-Wrenching Video Shows Two Boys Mourning Their Brother Who Was Killed In Syria AirstrikeThe conflict has destroyed several cities and displaced millions of people. The SOHR, in a statement, said that since the revolution began, as many as 494,438 people have been killed as of May 30, 2021.AFPThe destruction of Syria began in 2011 amid the Arab Spring  which touched many countries in West Asia and North Africa  as people protested against the Assad regime and sought political and economic reforms. The pro-democracy demonstrations erupted in the southern city of Deraa. The protests turned violent as the government tried to suppress them using force against the protesters. This resulted in the spread of the protests nationwide.The widespread protests and the governments brutal response to it led to a section of protesters taking up arms against the government forces, which they believed were killing people indiscriminately. President Assad was quick to dub the protests as foreign sponsored as he vowed to crush them at any cost.AFPThe small incidents of violence took no time in turning into full-fledged armed struggle between the protesters and the government forces. Several rebel groups came to the scene with arms and ammunition and even the small streets in many cities turned into battlegrounds. It did not take long for the conflict to become more than a battle between Syrians for or against President Assad.There was a complete confusion as many groups claiming to be helping the local people had taken up arms. They were taking on the mighty and organized Syrian army, which resulted only in deaths of many non-combatants. The Assad regime showed no mercy to the Opposition whatsoever. Many people chose to leave Syria for neighbouring countries. Most of the Syrian refugees went to Turkey.AFPSeeing an opportunity to make an inroads in the larger picture of West Asia, many countries chose to take sides. They did this by sending money, weaponry and fighters. With the worsening of the situation, extremist organisations including the Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaeda, became involved. That deepened concern among the international community, who saw them as a major threat.As the Islamists groups took over first the protest and then the armed conflict against the Assad regime, the biggest loser turned out to be the people of Syria, most of those who would not escape to safer places. Even now, there is little hope for them. The democracy remains as it was, Assads power is intact, and scope for political change has shrunk even further.According to SOHR, at least 1,59,774 Syrians, out of which 1,19,591 were men, 25,048 children and 15,135 women, were killed in the war, while the death toll of Syrian fighters of rebel and Islamic factions and other various factions was reported at 79,844.Also Read: First War, Then COVID-19 And Now Oil Spills Are Putting Syrians At RiskAmong government forces, 91,031 members have perished while 66,995 members of National Defence Forces (NDF) fighters and Syrian regime loyalists and 12,926 members of Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) and Kurdish units have also been killed.The report notes that as many as 31,227 civilians, including 214 children under the age of 18, were killed under torture in regime prisons.Over 47,000 civilians killed under torture in the detention centres and prisons of Assad's regime.Besides all this, the ongoing military operations, shelling, bombardment and various explosions have injured more than 2.1 million Syrian civilians with varying injuries, wounds and permanent disabilities.Around 13,000,000 other civilians, including hundreds of thousands of children and women, have been displaced.Furthermore, infrastructure, hospitals, schools, and private and public property have been substantially damaged or destroyed, the observatory said.The SOHR informed that 8,672 civilians, 5,252 adult and young men, 2,099 children under the age of eighteen and 1,321 women have been killed by Russian ground and aerial attacks.More than 5 million Syrians have fled the country and 6 million are internally displaced. With more than 13 million people in need of assistance, the conflict has caused untold suffering for Syrian men, women and children.Indiatimes has been following the conflict and the humanitarian crisis in Syria. Our correspondent Muhammad Adeeb had sent video reports from the ground, bringing to the forth the real situation for our readers.

541769," After fruits and vegetables, farmers of Indore are destroying potato and onion crops since they are also rotting due to the closure of the main mandis, as per TOI.At the time of harvesting, the potato was being sold at Rs 6-8/kg in mandi, which was insufficient to even meet the cost of seeds. As the lockdown extended, potato crops kept at my residence started rotting since I could not sell them due to closure of mandis, said Ram Singh, a farmer from Ratankedi village.TOIFarmers leader Bablu Jadhav, Narendra Singh said, in Murkheda village of Depalpur a farmer had to destroy his ready crop of coriander sown in around 1 acre, while another farmer of Badolihoj village in Depalpur destroyed his muskmelon crop due to closure of mandis since he had to prepare the farm for next harvest.Similarly, Vinod Singh Jadhav of Baloda Takun village had bumper production of watermelon. But reducing prices to Rs 5 to Rs 7 per kg was not enough for him even to meet the cost of farming, labourers and transportation.ANIAnother farmer of Gautampura Mahesh Bhut has also destroyed bottle gourd crops, which he had produced in 10 bigha of farmland, due to the same reasons.Amid Covid-19 crisis, rotting crops, unsold produce and falling incomes have become a major concern for farmers. As restrictions of janta curfew have halted peoples movement, farmers, due to shortage of buyers and labourers to work in the farms, are forced to dump their produce as they have to prepare the farms for the next crop, Jadhav said.In the past couple of days, videos have surfaced from Kolar in Karnataka showing farmers dumping truckloads of tomatoes on the roadside due to low prices.The farmers said that they were being offered Rs 2 for 15 kgs, which won't even cover the transport cost.According to farmers due to the lockdown and restrictions on interstate transport, the number of trucks going from Karnataka to states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu have reduced, which has resulted in the low demand in the market.It is not just vegetable growers in Karnataka that have been struggling to sell their produce. Even flower farmers in Kolar had recently dumped loads of their produce on the road."

541765," On Tuesday, China's National Health Commission (NHC) confirmed the first-ever known case of human infection of a rare strain of bird flu known as H10N3.According to the authorities, the patient, a resident of the city of Zhenjiang in the eastern province of Jiangsu was hospitalized on April 28 and diagnosed with H10N3 on May 28.BCCLThough the implications of the human transmission are yet unclear, initial reports suggest that H10N3 is low pathogenic, which means it causes relatively less severe disease in poultry and is unlikely to cause a large-scale outbreak.This comes at a time when China is facing global scrutiny over the dubious origins of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Though China has tried everything to confuse the world, there is a general consensus that the virus originated in China.AFPIn fact, China has a history of 'reporting first case of human infection' of a virus from animals or birds.The origins of COVID-19 are still unclear and Chiana has been deliberately making it difficult for the world to find it. Though the first know cases were from Wuhan, China has tried to spin it as the infection was first reported in the country than it originated there.File ImageIn the past, China has claimed that the virus may have entered the country from imported Salmon, shrimp, or frozen meat instead of the widely accepted theory that the virus transmitted from bats or pangolins to humans in the wet markets of Wuhan.Before COVID-19 the most notable animal to human transmission of a virus was the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003.SARS which first emerged in China had spread to other countries before the outbreak was brought under control. The epidemic affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8,000 cases in 2003.IJBSAccording to scientists, the virus infected humans through the intermediary of Asian palm civets to cave-dwelling horseshoe bats in Xiyang Yi Ethnic Township, Yunnan.H7N9 is a strain of bird flu, that was first reported to have infected humans in March 2013, in China.BCCLSince then the reemergence of the virus has been reported in the country multiple times and several deaths from it. The infection in humans has not been reported outside China.Last year, it was reported that researchers in China discovered a new type of swine flu that is capable of triggering another pandemic. According to a study published in the US science journal PNAS the new virus has been named as G4, and it is genetically descended from the H1N1 strain that caused a pandemic in 2009, but with some new changes.REUTERSIt possesses ""all the essential hallmarks of being highly adapted to infect humans,"" say the authors, scientists at Chinese universities and China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention. From 2011 to 2018, researchers took 30,000 nasal swabs from pigs in slaughterhouses in 10 Chinese provinces and in a veterinary hospital, allowing them to isolate 179 swine flu viruses."

The frequency of such intense weather events is expected to amplify over the coming years.India's western coast does not see many cyclones, but the frequency of the same has increased in the Arabian Sea at the rate of one per year since 2018.The development of the cyclones is also linked to micro-climatic warming over land in these regions.BCCLThe rising surface temperatures of the waters over the Arabian Sea is seen as the primary factor in the increasing frequency and intensity of cyclones over it.""The southwesterly winds could strengthen further gradually from June 1, resulting in likely enhancement in rainfall activity over Kerala. Hence, the monsoon onset over Kerala is likely to take place around June 3,"" the IMD has said.In a tweet, the weather department on Sunday said, ""The northern limit of Southwest Monsoon continues to pass through 5N/72E, 6N/75E, 8N/80E, 12N/85E, 14N/90E and 17N/94E.

These rewards from the bill payments were his earnings.Put it this way, at 5% cash back, theres $50 generated from every $1000 spent.

541720," Lockdown has been tough, no denial. You are restricted from making movement, can't go out freely and while away time for anything non-essential. But what could be non-essential to someone might extremely essential for someone else.Take this case. A man in the Gadag district of Karanataka went out during the lockdown imposed across the state to visit a veterinarian to see his pet hen. The reason: the hen had constipation issues. Now before you laugh, or no worry, you can laugh for a minute, consider this: The man argued that his hen is actually suffering from constipation and need to be treated by a veterinarian.The police in #Gadag had a hearty laugh after a man claimed be was taking the hen to a vet as it had constipation issues. Police however sent him back home he was halted by the police at the check post and enquired but failed to convince the cops of his reasoning who were amused to hear his excuse.Now some of you might be wondering how did the man know that the hen is suffering from constipation or if at all hens suffer from constipation. Well, this seems to be on everybodys mind who watched the video. And one of the readers even shared a blog post that claimed that chickens, like humans, do overeat sometimes, and that could be the reason that the man's hen was suffering from constipation.TwitterWell, good to know of it but we would leave the scholarly learning of the fact for a later date for now.At the moment, like many readers of the post, we want to be impressed with man's ingenuity to come up with such an excuse to go out during lockdown.However, this is not the first time when anyone has come up with such amusing ideas to circumvent the lockdown restriction. A few weeks back, a man in West Bengal ventured out during lockdown wearing a large note around his neck which read - ""Going To Buy Mishti Doi"". Even then, the police didn't get convinced and sent the man back home.In Gadag too, police sent the man back and advised him to home-treat the ""constipated"" hen."

541718," In a hilarious goof-up, a TV reporter in Argentina made a blunder after she announced the death of ""important writer"" William Shakespeare. Reportedly, she mistook an 81-year-old man with the same name as that of the playwright in an evening report.The reporter, Noelia Novillo reported that William Shakespeare, ""one of the most important writers in the English language"", died recently. She was actually reporting the death of William (Bill) Shakespeare, an 81-year-old man from Coventry in the UK who died five months after getting the COVID-19 vaccine.Instagram""We've got the news that has stunned all of us given the greatness of this man. We're talking about William Shakespeare and his death. We'll let you know how and why it happened,"" Novillo said on live TV.She was oblivious to the error she has made even she the footage of the Warwickshire man appeared on the screen. She continued to say, ""As we all know, he's one of the most important writers in the English language  for me the master. Here he is. He was the first man to get the coronavirus vaccine. He died in England at the age of 81.""Bill Shakespeare was the second person to get the Pfizer vaccine in December last year.

She didn't actually mean it, did she? #Shakespeare.'Another user commented, 'Ok ... If that man really was called 'William Shakespeare' and he was a 'famous writer' ... Wow!

541717," Concerned over the increasing number of divorces in the state, the Goa Government said it is planning to make premarital counselling mandatory for couples wanting to tie the knot.According to Goa law minister Nilesh Cabral, the state is seeing equal to the number of divorces as marriages and many of them within six months to two years of marriage.UNSPLASH""We are coming up with a new policy to make premarital counselling mandatory in the state. We may also rope in religious institutions for the same,"" he said.""Many divorces are taking place within six months to one year of marriage. As a policy, we thought that premarital counselling should be made compulsory to create awareness among couples,"" Cabral said.He, however, said that the official data on the number of divorces or annulments of marriage was still being compiled by the department.According to Cabral the counselling would be done immediately after the first signature and would be conducted through the Goa Institute of Public Administration and Rural Development (GIPARD) but religious institutes could also be roped in to provide pre-marriage counselling sessions.UNSPLASHAccording to the proposal, couples will have to undergo counselling after the first signature and only after obtaining the certificate of completion, they will be eligible for the second signature.As per the Goa Civil Code the first signature is the couples declaration of intent to marry before the civil registrar. The second signature before the same authority, after 15 days of the first signature and within three months, is the formal marriage registration.UnsplashMany in the state however felt that politicians needed to be counseled first.Ketan Bhatikar, a member of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party said that instead of couples, such counselling should be first administered to ministers and ruling MLAs.

541715," The Delhi High Court said that private unaided schools in the national capital can collect annual school fees from their students as fixed earlier, with a deduction of 15 per cent in lieu of unutilised facilities during the lockdown period.The High Court added that the Delhi government has no power to indefinitely postpone collection of annual charges and development fees by private schools as it would unreasonably restrict their functioning.BCCLSchools can now collect the annual fees for the academic year 2020-21, as fixed and approved, with a 15 per cent deduction. The fees can be collected by schools retrospectively, since the academic year 2020-21 is over.The amount payable by students will be paid in six monthly instalments with effect from June 10. This will apply to all students who attended school in the last academic year, including those who are awaiting a decision on their Class 12 Board exams.RepresentationalThis High Courts judgment brings about a big change in the school fee collection system. Due to the financial distress faced by parents, schools had so far been permitted to collect only tuition fees on a monthly basis for the academic year 2020-21.The high court quashed the office orders of April and August 2020 issued by the Directorate of Education (DoE) of the Delhi government forbidding and postponing collection of annual charges and development fees, saying they were illegal and ultra vires the powers of the respondent stipulated under the Delhi School Education Act and the Rules.Representational Image/iStockLast April, in the early days of the 2020 national lockdown, the Delhi government had issued an order stating that No fee, except tuition fee, will be charged from parents during the lockdown period. The tuition fees were to be collected on a monthly basis, as opposed to lumpsum quarterly or annual demands. The order said: Annual and Development charges can be charged from the parents, on pro-rata basis, only on monthly basis after completion of lockdown period.Thereafter, in August, as a phased unlock took place in the city, many schools began to collect annual and developmental fees on a pro-rata basis. However, the government doubled down on its April order on the ground that students had still not gone back to class in person, and that schools were still physically shut.BCCLThe order had stated that restrictions in fee collection would continue to stand, because unlocking stage is still going on in phase manner hence, complete lockdown is yet to be over and schools are yet to be open for physical classroom learning.These have remained the standing orders from the government. No fresh directives were issued after this."
541712," Weve all heard the saying, early to bed, early to rise makes us healthy and wise. However, now a new study has revealed that waking up just an hour before their usual schedule could reduce the risk of major depression by 23 percent.Getty imagesAlso Read: Masturbation May Actually Give You A Good Night's Sleep, According To This German CompanyThis is according to an eye-opening (see what I did there) study published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry involving 840,000 people by researchers at the University of Colorado, Boulder and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.The study puts forth the strongest evidence that a persons chronotype -- the time a person sleeps every day -- massively influences depression risk.Researchers teamed up with DNA testing company 23 and Me, looking at DNA data as well as biomedical database UK Biobank. They then implemented a method called Mendelian randomisation that makes use of genetic associations to help find the cause and effect.Lead author Iyas Daghlas explains, Our genetics are set at birth so some of the biases that affect other kinds of epidemiological research tend not to affect genetic studies.Over 340 common genetic variants including the clock gene dubbed PER2 are known to affect a persons chronotype. Moreover, genetics collectively explains 12 to42 percent of our sleep timing preference.Also Read: Sleeping Less Impacts Your Metabolism And Makes You Fat, Claims A New Health StudyResearchers looked at deidentified genetic data on these variants from up to 850,000 individuals. This included data from 85,000 individuals who wore sleep trackers while sleeping as well as 250,000 individuals who filled out sleep preference questionnaires.UnsplashFrom the largest samples, around a third of the surveyed subjects self-identified as morning people, 9 percent were late night owls and the rest were somewhere in the middle. Overall, the average sleep midpoint was at 3:00 AM -- they went to bed at 11:00 PM and got up at 6:00 AM.With this data, researchers looked at a different sample which included genetic information along with anonymised medical and prescription records and surveys about diagnoses of major depressive disorder.Also Read: NASA Will Pay You Rs 13 Lakh To Sleep In Bed And Do Nothing For Two MonthsWith all this info, and the help of statistical techniques they asked whether those with genetic variants which make them wake up early also had a lower risk of depression? As a matter of fact, it did.UnsplashEach one-hour earlier sleep midpoint corresponded with 23 percent lower risk of major depressive disorder. This basically means that if someone who normally goes to bed at 1:00 AM goes to bed at midnight and instead sleeps the same duration, they could cut their risk of depression by 23 percent; sleeping before 11 could cut this by 40 percent.Researchers highlight that it's unclear if those who are early risers already could benefit from getting up even earlier but people who are in the intermediate range could surely benefit from this."
541711," Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus shows the B.1.525 variant, which was first reported in the UK in February 2021, is present in Telangana, as per TNN.Enlisted as the variant of interest by WHO, out of the 22 samples randomly analysed in April and May in India, 16 are in Telangana.This variant was also discovered in Australia and Denmark and has been linked to people travelling to Nigeria and getting infected.This variety is already present in almost 50 countries and been declared variant of interest out of six variants of interest of Covid-19 in the world. If a region is displaying samples, we need to observe the trend more carefully, a senior specialist in genome sequencing from Bangalore said.However, we cannot come to a conclusion on this immediately, she added.BCCLGISAID is the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza maintained by World Health Organization (WHO) and they regularly update the samples from across the globe, even to the district level. The data shows that in May, three samples of B1525 collected from the country were from Telangana. In April, out of 19 samples of this variant found in India, 13 were from Telangana.The GISAID data of genome sequencing of SARSCoV-2 also shows that the state also has more of B.1.617. 2 lineage as expected.The B.1.617 variant, first found in Maharashtra has three different sublineages, B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3.Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) former director Rakesh Mishra said that data can be much more comprehensive than what is uploaded on GISAID.Many of the samples in May are of B.1.617. 2 lineage but more data has still to be submitted to GISAID. But the Covid-19 situation cannot just be assessed by presence of variants, the lockdowns and other Covid-19 appropriate measures have also an impact, Mishra said.PTIAny variant can be presumed to be strongly present only when samples are collected from community and not from airport. Most samples may have been from the airport, Mishra added.Samples in April were collected from Hyderabad, Secunderabad, Vikarabad, Nagarkurnool, Warangal and Jogulamba Gadwal districts and in May samples were collected only from Hyderabad.Dr Kiran Madala, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) certified researcher, pointed out the presence of B.1.617.2 lineage indicates high infection spread."

541698," London's busy Heathrow Airport has now opened a dedicated new terminal for arrivals from countries designated as ""red list"", such as India, for a higher risk of COVID-19 transmission. Travellers on direct flights from such destinations will now go through Terminal 3 and then move directly to a government-approved quarantine facility booked at the passengers' own expense.Additionally, anyone who has been in a red list country in the previous 10 days, whether they took a direct flight or came via another country, is required to pay for quarantine in a hotel for 10 nights after their arrival.APIt comes after airport staff raised fears for their safety because of overcrowding, amid concerns that travellers arriving from red list countries  from where travel is effectively banned except for British and Irish nationals or limited exceptions. The staff's concern was that the passengers from 'red' were mixing with those from green and amber. People coming from different lists were getting stuck in a bottleneck before immigration.AFPCurrently, there are 43 countries on the UK government's red list to cover regions linked with high-risk COVID-19 variants such as India, Brazil and South Africa. ""Red list routes will likely be a feature of UK travel for the foreseeable future as countries vaccinate their populations at different rates,"" a Heathrow Airport spokesperson said.""We're adapting Heathrow to this longer-term reality by initially opening a dedicated arrivals facility in Terminal 3 from 1 June for red list passengers arriving on direct flights. While opening this facility will be logistically very challenging, our hope is that it will enable Border Force to carry out its duties more efficiently as passenger volumes increase in line with the green list. Until then, the current red list system will remain in place,"" the spokesperson said.ReutersAccording to officials, the latest system has been designed with several layers of COVID-19 security, including mandatory negative COVID-19 tests for all international arrivals, mandatory use of face coverings, social distancing, segregation and enhanced cleaning regimes and ventilation in immigration halls. ""We will move this facility to Terminal 4 as soon as operationally possible,"" the Heathrow spokesperson said.AFPA UK government spokesperson said the enhanced borders regime was to reduce the risk of new variants being transmitted. ""As we reopen international travel safely, we will maintain 100 per cent health checks at the border and the new dedicated terminal at Heathrow for arrivals from red list countries will enable passengers to be processed as safely and as efficiently as possible, before being transferred to a managed quarantine facility,"" the spokesperson said."
541696," An Australian scientist has discovered a new species of frog in the rainforest swamps of New Guinea. Steve Richards, a frog specialist at the South Australia Museum, first spotted the cocoa hued amphibian in 2016. Later, scientists at the Queensland Museum gave it the moniker of chocolate frog due to its brown coloured skin, a feature that distinguishes it from other tree frogs.According to the scientist, the frog species which is now named as Litoria Mira is a close relative of the Australian green tree frog, which is green in colour.Steve RichardsThe closest known relative of Litoria mira is the Australian green tree frog. The two species look similar except one is usually green, while the new species usually has a lovely chocolate colouring, Dr Paul Oliver, Centre for Planetary Health and Food Security and Queensland Museum said.According to the researchers, the discovery is once again proof that Australia and New Guinea (together referred to as Sahul) were linked by land for much of the late Tertiary (2.6 million years ago) and share many biotic elements.We named this new Litoria frog species Mira, which means surprised or strange in Latin, because it was a surprising discovery to find a an over-looked relative of Austalias well-known and common green tree living in the lowland rainforests of New Guinea, Richards said.Steve RichardsEstimates for divergence of the new species in our study shows that in the Pliocene (5.3 to 2.6 million years ago) there was still connectivity between the two species the across lowland tropical habitats of northern Australia and New Guinea.These results emphasise that the extent and connectivity of lowland rainforest and savannah environments across northern Australia and southern New Guinea and the profound shifts the region has undergone since the late Pliocene, Oliver said."

With no notch present on the front of the screen, chances are that the phone still wont get FaceID for unlocking the device.Twitter: Apple LabAdditionally, we cannot see a TouchID sensor at the front, however, with the recently unveiled iPad Air, we saw Apple put a fingerprint sensor on the lock button. We could expect a similar implementation for the iPhone SE 3.Leaks online have been hinting at two specific screen sizes -- a 5.5-inch screen and a 6.1-inch screen. The latter has been hinted by analyst Ross Young. As per the leaks, the device will continue to sport an LCD panel to stand apart from Apples premium offerings. Leaks still havent shed any light on the kind of resolution we can expect, but it would be safe to assume it should be at least a 720p panel.The current generation iPhone SE which was based on the iPhone 8 is equipped with the previous generations A13 Bionic. So with the iPhone SE 3, we can safely expect it to sport the A14 Bionic CPU (built on the 5nm process) thats seen on the iPhone 12.Also Read: iPhone 13 Could Finally Sport 120Hz Screen, Leaks RevealiPhone SE 3 is expected to still sport a single-camera module at the back, to keep the costs low.

He predicted it would be unveiled by the year 2023. Leaks have also hinted that the device could be expected in similar storage variants as the SE 2020 -- 64GB, 128GB and 256GB.As it goes without saying, take these leaks with a grain of salt. However, if this phone looks just as pretty in reality, it would surely compete fiercely with the flagship iPhone lineup. What do you think about these renders? Tell us in the comments below."

541635," The world needs the cooperation of China to trace the origins of COVID and prevent future pandemic threats, two leading US disease experts said according to a Bloomberg report, cited in TOI.Information to support the theory that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be an escapee from a lab in Wuhan, China, has increased, said Scott Gottlieb, who is a commissioner of the FDA during the Trump administration. He now sits on the board of Pfizer Inc.China hasnt provided evidence to disprove that theory, while the search for signs that the virus emerged from wildlife hasnt yielded results, Gottlieb said on CBS Newss Face the Nation.Not knowing how the pandemic started puts the world at risk of future outbreaks, Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Childrens Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, said in a separate TV appearance.AFPTheres going to be Covid-26 and Covid-32 unless we fully understand the origins of Covid-19, Hotez said on NBCs Meet the press.Almost a year and half after the new pathogen was first detected spreading in a seafood market in Wuhan, China, the precise origins of the virus remain obscure. Scientists have hypothesized that it most likely spread from wild animals to humans. The idea that the virus may have accidentally escaped from a research lab, long promoted by some Republicans, has gotten renewed attention from the Biden administration.AFPIn a surprise statement on Wednesday, President Joe Biden called for a renewed investigation into the viruss emergence. US intelligence agencies had conflicting assessments of whether it was more likely the virus crossed the species barrier from a natural reservoir or leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Biden said. He ordered the agencies to redouble their efforts and report to him again in 90 days.Debate over the viruss origin was fueled anew by a Wall Street Journal report on May 23 that three researchers from Chinas Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick enough in November 2019 that they sought hospital care for symptoms consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illness.Scientists should be allowed to conduct a long-term investigation in China and take blood samples from humans and animals, Hotez said. The US should pressure China, including with the threat of sanctions, to allow for an inquiry.We need a team of scientists, epidemiologists, virologists, bat ecologists in Hubei province for a six-month, year-long period, Hotez said.Chinese officials have disputed the Wuhan lab theory. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian on Thursday dismissed Bidens inquiry as an attempt to engage in stigmatization, political manipulation and blame-shifting.A World Health Organization report released in March didnt fully uncover the viruss origin but called a lab leak unlikely. The global health body called for more investigation at that time.As far as WHO is concerned, all hypotheses remain on the table, director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement when the March report was released."

One such example is this video that is going viral on social media - it features two men on a roller coaster ride at a theme park in Barcelona, Spain.What is special about it? Well, imagine being on a roller coaster ride and dropping your phone, oh wait, let's make it worse - dropping your iPhone.

Others include two house-sized asteroids and one airplane-sized asteroid, passing with distances that range from 11 lakh kilometers to 59 lakh kilometers.Due to their small sizes, they are not considered potentially dangerous by NASA.However, since KT1 is much bigger in size, the space agency categorised asteroids bigger than 150 meters and that passes within 75 lakh kilometers as potentially hazardous.AstronomyAccording to NASA, such celestial objects warrant close observation, since changing gravitational pull coming from moving planets can change the path of an asteroid making it Earth-crossing over a period of time.If such an asteroid hits the planet, the impact will be devastating. But NASA has developed technologies that can send a huge mass to collide with a dangerous asteroid to break it and also deflect its path.PixabayBefore technology took over, our planet has been hit by many small asteroids and meteoroids in the past."

541609," Mohammad Yousuf Kakroo, 60, a walnut grower in the busy market of Lagama in north Kashmirs Uri, is hopeful to supply a good quantity of walnut produce to other states this year.Last year it was COVID scare, but since the vaccine has been made available, we have taken a sigh of relief, he told Indiatimes.This year, we are expecting that all the walnut shops will remain open fully and able to do business normally so as to meet the losses suffered so far, he said.Idrees Bukhtiyar | IndiatimesFor over a century, Uri boasts of the Lagama market where Indias finest walnut kernels are sold. Located few kilometers away from the Line of Control (LoC), Lagama is located on Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road in Uri sector and occupies a very important position in the current history for being Indias main contributor of walnut production and also of its Kashmiri Pandit population.Kakroo said that a lot of stock has piled up in the shops due to its non-transportation last year.We were only able to transport 3,000 kgs of kernels but earlier we used to sell up to 10,000 kgs, he said.It is pertinent to mention here that the Lagama market opens only for two month when traders and growers sell their kernels. It opens at the end of August till October. Those days growers can be seen usually working during the night hours and getting their stock packed in the trucks to be dispatched outside the valley.Shabir Ahmad Bhat, another grower from Garkote village of Uri said that Goods and Services Tax (GST) has ruined their business.Whatever we are earning has to pay it as GST. Whenever we supply the stock to the trader to sell it further, we have to pay him with the GST amount first, he said, adding there are dozens of families in the area who are totally dependent on the business.Idrees Bukhtiyar | IndiatimesTraders in Uri employ daily-wage labourers for plucking walnuts that are to be cleaned to be sold. Due to a lockdown, no labourer came forward. Those who did, demand a heavy price, said Mohammad Amin Chalkoo, a trader.Few years back we used to pay Rs 500 per day to a labourer to pluck the walnuts; now they are charging Rs 1,000 or more. If there is a delay in plucking the walnuts it naturally leads to drop in the prices, he said.Walnuts from Uri are transported to Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, especially around Diwali. There are 25 wholesale traders in Lagama and over 60 local sellers.The post August 5, 2019, has worsened the situation for the traders. Lagama used to do the turnover business of Rs 10-20 crore or more before Article 370 issue but now we have been facing losses in crores, he said.Idrees Bukhtiyar | IndiatimesThe condition is so bad that we are unable to pay the debit taken from the banks to run our businesses, he said.Almonds, a top dry fruit that grows in valley and Kashmir has won great reputation. Kashmir Almonds are often referred to as King of Fruits. They are smaller in size as compared to California almonds.Idrees Bukhtiyar | IndiatimesOwing to the climate of Kashmir, where the temperature does not exceed 32 degrees, the Kashmiri Almonds are very sweet. They have 42% oil content in them. Interestingly, Kashmir also has the historic almond garden called Badamwari, on the foothills of historic Kohe-Maran in Srinagar and holds much significance as it heralds the arrival of spring in Kashmir.Idrees Bukhtiyar | IndiatimesIn the valley, central Kashmirs Budgam district is considered to produce the highest quantity of almonds. Though the production continues to be good but inability to supply the orders has affected the business, says Mohammad Shafi, a walnut grower.He said, Post August 5 situation and then COVID lockdown has played a spoilsports with our business. The government too has not helped us. Everything has been shut here since 2019. Businesses open here partially and with a risk. We have even been unable to send the stock to the local traders too, he says.Idrees Bukhtiyar | IndiatimesAnother grower Hameed Ahmad from Budgam said that weather has also impacted its growth.Untimely rains and snow kill its production, he said adding, The almonds are also brought from places like California and other countries to Kashmir which has caused a dip in the price and its sale.Mohd Aslam who runs a dry fruit shop in Maharaja Bazar of Srinagar hoped that things will turn normal soon.If there is a relaxation in the curfew, the businesses will run smoothly again and we will be able to reach out to our customers, he said.Kashmirs own dry fruits, be it walnut, almonds or others, will continue to tickle the taste buds of outsiders as usual, he said and signed off."

On the other hand, Tokyo might have been the last chance for Saina to challenge for a second Olympics medal as she would be 35 by 2024.Their chances of making it to the Olympics were significantly depleted by postponement of a number of tournaments that served as qualifiers, most notably the Indian Open, the Malaysian Open, and the Singapore Open, in March and April.The three tournaments were the last in the qualification calendar and were all deferred amid a deadly second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India.BCCL""The Olympic qualification process is in effect closed as there are no additional opportunities for players to earn points,"" said BWF secretary general Thomas Lund.""However, we still need to receive confirmations from National Olympic Committees and Member Associations, followed by any possible reallocations, and this will take a number of weeks to complete,"" he said.Invitations will be sent shortly, with final participation lists and seedings to be published at the conclusion of this process, the BWF said."
541494," A season marked by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the shockwaves of the failed attempt to create a breakaway Super League reaches its climax on Saturday, when Pep Guardiola's Manchester City and Thomas Tuchel's Chelsea clash in an-all English Champions League final in Porto.The finalists were among the group of 12 clubs that announced their breakaway project in April but were also among the first to withdraw in the face of fan anger -- those supporters are now hoping to be celebrating European glory in Portugal this weekend.It is the third final of Europe's elite club competition to be played between two Premier League sides, and the second in just three seasons, such is the financial might of the modern English game.AFPAnd these are the two clubs whose own transformations in the last two decades under mega-rich foreign owners have done the most to change forever the landscape of the Premier League.Chelsea and City have not met in a final since 1986 in the short-lived Full Members Cup, when the London club won 5-4 at Wembley.That was before the Premier League and modern Champions League existed, before Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003 and before the Abu Dhabi takeover of City in 2008. Between them they have now won seven of the last 10 Premier League titles.Chelsea have the experience of this stage in Europe before, having beaten Bayern Munich on penalties in the 2012 final. They have also won the Europa League twice since then.City have never made it this far before but are finally here, after 13 years of enormous investment under Sheikh Mansour and four previous years of disappointment under Guardiola, the man who was hired principally to win them this competition.AFP""When you reach the final of the Champions League you finish part of the process that started five years ago,"" said Guardiola on Friday.After romping to the Premier League title, their third in four seasons, and having also won the League Cup, a City side starring the likes of Kevin De Bruyne and Ruben Dias are the clear favourites at the Estadio do Dragao.Agencies""We as players understand the magnitude of the game,"" playmaker De Bruyne said on Friday. ""If you win you're a hero, if you lose you're almost a failure.""Chelsea have been transformed since Tuchel replaced Frank Lampard as coach in January, even if they did finish the domestic season with three defeats in four games including the FA Cup final against Leicester City.They have beaten City twice in the last six weeks, first in the Cup semi-final and then in Manchester in the league.Agencies""They are maybe in the moment the strongest team in Europe and maybe the world. They have built a huge gap between them and us in the league but we closed the gap for 90 minutes at Wembley and away at City and this is what we want to do tomorrow,"" Tuchel said on Friday.Covid-19 again casts its shadow over the final, which is being played in Porto following the last-minute decision to move it from Istanbul.The Turkish metropolis was denied the chance to host the occasion for the second year running after the UK government put the country on its travel red list, preventing fans of either finalist from attending the game from England.Just like last year when Lisbon was the last-minute solution, Portugal rode to the rescue again, with the country one of the few on the UK's green travel list.AFPThere can be few more charming host cities than Porto, with its cobbled streets tumbling down towards the waterfront which looks across to the Port wine warehouses on the other side of the Douro River.English fans began gathering on Friday on cafe terraces under blazing blue skies. With Portuguese authorities allowing the Estadio do Dragao to be filled to 33 percent capacity, there will be 16,500 spectators in total in the ground, including 6,000 fans of each club.AgenciesMany more are expected in the city without tickets and there will be two fan zones, one for supporters of each side, including one under a giant inflatable Champions League trophy on the city's main Avenida dos Aliados.A negative coronavirus test is required to enter but fans are being permitted to consume alcohol before being bussed off to the match venue."

541489," Domestic air travel is set to become costlier as the Civil Aviation Ministry raised the lower limit on fares by 13 to 16 per cent, according to an official order. The increase in airfares will come into effect from 1 June, it said.The upper limits on fares remain unchanged. The government has raised the lower limits to help the airlines amid a devastating second wave of COVID-19 , which has reduced air travel significantly. India had imposed lower and upper limits on airfares based on flight duration when services were resumed on May 25 last year after a two-month lockdown.ReutersOn Friday, the official order said the lower limit for flights under 40 minutes of duration will be increased from Rs 2,300 to Rs 2,600 an increase of 13 per cent. Similarly, flights with duration between 40 minutes and 60 minutes will have a lower limit of Rs 3,300 instead of Rs 2,900 now, the order said.The move comes just over three months since the last hike in domestic air fares.

541488," Dr Nikhil Tandon, Professor and Head, Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, AIIMS, New Delhi, explains what is causing a sudden surge in mucormycosis in Covid patients, and how we can prevent and treat it effectively.Mucormycosis is a fungal disorder. Fungi are present extensively in our environment. If mucormycete spores enters the nostrils of a healthy human being, the bodys immunity fights off the infection and does not let the disease happen. But in people with compromised immunity, these spores, transform in to hyphae, invade and cause the disease. Prior to the COVID epidemic, the mucormycosis infection was observed in patients with uncontrolled diabetes, especially in an acute condition called diabetes ketoacidosis, cancer patients,especially in those on chemotherapy, and individuals with HIV disease among others.AFP/representational imageThe current wave of mucormycosis, however, seems to be directly related to Covid-19 and is widely affecting people who have Covid or are recovering from it.Three reasons that may have contributed to this sudden surge of mucormycosis cases are i) a large number of Covid-19 patients in a small duration of time, ii) new variants of SARS-Cov-2, and iii) concurrently uncontrolled diabetes in these Covid patientsEarly data from AIIMS suggest that a significant number of patients currently being diagnosed with mucormycosis had uncontrolled diabetes. Over and above this, we have seen a significant increase in the use and misuse of steroid. Steroids though a preferred treatment for moderate to severe Covid-19 patients, have to be given at a specific time, for a pre-defined duration, and in pre-defined doses. Injudicious use of steroids, including by self-medication can do more harm than good. All these factors have led to the recent surge in the mucormycosis cases.Black Fungus is a term given by people. Mucoromycetes is not black coloured fungus. It is an invasive fungus; it invades smaller and bigger blood vessels, diminishes the blood supply to the tissues and kills them. The dead tissue looks black in colour.BCCL/Representational imageMucormycosis , if not detected and treated, is potentially damaging. In immuno-suppressant individuals, it can cause lots of morbidity. For example, if it travels from the nose and sinuses towards the eye, it can damage the vision. If it travels into the brain, it could be fatal.This fungus is present almost everywhere so, it is difficult to completely avoid the exposure. However, one can limit it by avoiding going to damp and humid places, farms, and dusty construction sites.Further, one should take all the precautions to protect oneself from catching Covid. Follow Covid-Appropriate Behaviour: wear masks, wash hands, avoid crowds, maintain physical distancing, and take the vaccine. If a person has diabetes, they must do everything to keep it under control.Reuters/Representational imageAnother important point that we tend to forget is any infection can lead to an increase in blood sugar levels. Besides, steroids also can cause an increase in blood sugar levels.This aspect must be kept in mind by the patient and the treating team  periodic screening for blood sugar must be done in all patients with COVID, so that early treatment can be initiated as soon as the blood sugar shows a tendency to rise.Most cases of mucormycosis are treatable. And if we detect them early, the damage can be controlled. Drug Amphotericin B is highly effective.Its liposomal version allows doctors to give adequate doses over a relatively shorter duration than possible with conventional preparations of this drug, thereby helping control the infection early.AP/Representational imageThere are two other preparations: Posaconazole, which we have used as a stepdown drug after we control the infection with amphotericin; and Isavuconazole. The latter is a relatively newer drug, but initial information suggest that it is also a promising agent for treating mucormycosis.Along with medications, surgical removal of the dead tissue is also strongly advocated."

Ironically, the cop who issued the challan wrongly cited the Motor Vehicle Act instead of the Gujarat Police Act.BCCLThe challan showed offence under section 184 of MV Act - which labels it driving dangerously. The TOI report said that the senior officials later confessed that the section mentioned is wrong.I was going to work on my bicycle and was on the wrong side near Gabheni crossroad when the traffic cops stopped me.

541472," Scientists have managed to create the largest map of our universes dark matter, which could also suggest that Einsteins theory of relativity wasnt quite right.DES Observations, Dark Energy Survey Collaboration via GuardianAlso Read: Dark Matter Data From Far Away Galaxies Raises More Questions Than AnswersResearchers have also managed to map the locations of vast cosmic voids -- places where the laws of physics that we commonly know, might not come into play.The way scientists were able to look for the existence of dark matter was by observing the light travelling to our planet from galaxies far away. For instance, if the light got distorted along the way, it was an indication of a matter present in the foreground, causing the light to bend as it made its way to Earth.The International Dark Energy Survey team has created a map that covers a quarter of the sky of the southern hemisphere using AI to analyse images of 100 million galaxies.The map shows pink, purple and black patches clustered inside a pale right which is essentially the image of the milky way, with the brightest areas of the map showing the densest areas of dark matter corresponding to superclusters of galaxies and black patches revealing cosmic voids.Dr Niall Jeffrey, of University College London and cole Normale Suprieure, Paris, who co-led the project, explains, It shows us new parts of the universe that weve never seen before. We can really see this cosmic web structure, including these enormous structures called cosmic voids, which are very low-density regions of the universe where there are very few galaxies and less matter.Also Read: Scientists Have Found A Particle That Could Be Portal Into Fifth DimensionMaps like these would allow scientists to observe their hypothesis that gravity behaves differently inside the cosmic web structures. Looking at the shapes and locations of the map could give scientists a place to start studying further.Getty ImagesDark matter is also known as unknown matter. Science has not been able to actually denote what dark matter really is and everyone has their own interpretation of it but all the interpretations agree on one thing -- it exists. According to scientists, the way dark matter marks its presence is through gravity. While gravity helps us stay where we are, what is actually holding things in place?Dark matter was originally known as missing mass (which makes more sense) and its existence was first inferred by Fritz Zwicky, a Swiss American astronomer who in 1933 stated that the mass of all-stars in the Coma cluster of galaxies provided only one percent of the mass needed to keep the galaxies from getting out of the gravitational pull of the galaxy. This mystery remained somewhat unsolved until in 1970 when American astronomers Vera Rubin and W. Kent Ford confirmed its existence.Einsteins theory of General Relativity stated that the dark matter was clumped together after the big bang, or thats what was believed until the map revealed that it was smoother than predicted.Getty ImagesAlso Read: Astronomers Have Found A Black Hole 300 Times Bigger Than Our Milky Way GalaxyAccording to the researchers, the structures on the map are a lot smoother than they expected. People might be of the opinion that physics as we know it is broken with this fundamental change, however, physicists see this as an opportunity to learn something new about the universe and how it functions."

""Collection of bones and ashes is completely safe as there is no risk of transmission of infection from the mortal remains,"" Gupta said. ""The study was conducted in the interest of preserving the dignity of the dead,"" he stated.Non-invasive autopsy techniques, as described in guidelines, should be used, if at all required, to prevent the risk of spreading the infection to mortuary staff, police personnel and contamination of mortuary surfaces, the guidelines stated. ""If the autopsy surgeon feels that he will not be able to conclude cause of death or any other related issue without dissection, then he can proceed with minimal invasive/limited internal dissection.Reuters/Image For Representation""However, the dissection has to be performed keeping in mind that the conduction of autopsy is a high-risk procedure which is potentially as hazardous as any other procedure performed on the body of a Covid-19 patient,"" the guidelines said, listing the precautions to be followed while conducting an autopsy by adopting proper infection control measures."

The feature would only work in a room that doesnt have louder noise for working accurately.Also Read: Smartwatch Claims To Detect Your Stress Levels, And It's Not Made By AppleThe Fitbit however, wont be able to distinguish between your snores or your partners. However, it will tell how much time throughout the night you spend snoring. The report highlights that Fitbit would have three levels of snoring -- from none to to mild which would indicate that the user snored for 10 percent of total sleep time, moderate which would indicate snoring time was 10 to 40 percent and frequent which would mean snoring time was over 40 percent of sleep time.Fitbit via 9to5GoogleAlso Read: Bill Gates Thinks Not Getting Enough Sleep Is A Disease, Recommends 'Why We Sleep As The CureAlong with this, if it doesnt really find any snoring, it would offer information on the level of ambient noise in your room scaling from very quiet (30 decibels or lower), quiet (30 to 50 decibels), moderate (50 to 70 decibels), loud (70 to 90 decibels) to very loud (90 decibels or higher).The feature has been rolled out in an update that can be done through Fitbit app version 3.42. Fitbit has highlighted that this would be a power-hungry feature and would require battery on the smartband/watch to be at least 40 percent."
541439," In the past 24 hours, India added more than 1.8 lakh new COVID-19 cases and 3,660 deaths from the virus infection.This is the lowest single-day rise in new cases reported in India in 44 days.This is also the second time this week the number of daily cases has fallen below the 2 lakhs mark.BCCLOn Monday, May 24, India had recorded 1.95 lakh COVID-19 infections in a day.On Friday the number of active cases further declined to 23.43 lakh while over 2.48 crore people have recovered from the virus till now.This comes as the country has been experiencing a slow down in new infections over the past few weeks, indicating that the worst of the second wave could be behind us.At its peak earlier this month India had recorded over 4.14 lakh cases in 24 hours, the highest ever recorded anywhere in the world.ReutersSince then the cases have been falling, thanks to the lockdowns in many worst-hit states.Except for Tamil Nadu, data from most of the states suggest that the second wave may have peaked there as well.At its peak Maharashtra, the worst-hit state had recorded over 67,000 cases in a day. That has now come down to nearly one-third at 21,000 in a day.In Karnataka, the second worst-hit state the daily tally has come down to half of the peak which was over 48,000 to 24,000 now.BCCLIn Delhi, the number of new cases has dropped from the high of over 28,000 to just over the 1,000 mark in the past few days.Another indication of the second wave of COVID-19 has crossed the peak is how the number of fatalities are gradually reducing.On May 18, India had recorded 4,519 deaths from COVID-19 in 24 hours, the highest so far. From that, the death toll has come down to around 3,500 in a day.While it is a good sign that the second wave of COVID-19 may have peaked, a daily infection of close to 2 lakhs is way too high.BCCLAt its peak on September 12, India had recorded 97,570 new cases and 1,201 deaths.With the infection rate slowing down again, many states have started planning to lift the restrictions.But there is also a growing fear that with the vaccination drive failing to keep up pace with the demand, opening up too early could see the virus coming back, which will undo all the work that was done in the past few months to arrest the spread."

It stressed the need for next phase studies as also for further data and studies to reach robust conclusions.AFPThe follow up of the WHO report and further studies deserve understanding and cooperation of all, said Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). According to a report by CNN, the WHO is expected to restudy the ""dominant theory"" that the SARS-CoV-2 probably originated and spread across the world from China's Wuhan lab.Our response to media queries on WHO convened global study on the origin of Covid-19: WHO sent a team of international researchers to Wuhan, where the virus originated, in January 2021 for the first time. The team spent four weeks in and around the city with Chinese researchers who said in a report in March that the virus had probably been transmitted from bats to humans through another animal, and that introduction through a laboratory incident was considered to be an extremely unlikely pathway.AFPMeanwhile, a leading scientist on the WHO's COVID-19 mission to China recently said that a follow-up trip could be helpful to gather additional research on the origins of the disease.The comments from Dutch virologist Marion Koopmans comes after the United States called for international experts to be allowed to evaluate the source of the coronavirus and the early days of the outbreak in a second phase of the WHO's investigation into the origins of the coronavirus, reported Reuters.AFPOn Thursday, the Joe Biden administration asked the US intelligence community to ""redouble their efforts"" to come to a conclusion on the origins of virus. The move rattled Beijing which termed the US President's statement as ""disrespect for science"" saying it is undermining global unity in the fight against the epidemic.Taiwan TimesThe Wuhan lab-leak theory which was considered a controversial hypothesis has now gained traction in the West. A classified US intelligence report recently claimed that three researchers at the Wuhan laboratory received treatment in a hospital in November 2019. This was even before the virus began infecting the people in the city."

541425," Researchers at Cornell University have broken their own record for capturing the highest resolution image of an individual atom ever captured, creating an image thats actually zoomed in 100 million times.Cornell UniversityAlso Read: This Is What An Exploding Atom Looks Like, When It Burns And Reveals Its Innermost SecretsThe photograph is an electron ptychographic reconstruction of a praseodymium orthoscandate crystal which has been zoomed in 100 million times.The method that the team used to capture this imagery is called ptychography in which a beam (in this instance, made of electrons) is repeatedly fired through an object of interest, from different positions and angles each time.By comparing the different patterns formed by the scattered beam, an algorithm reconstructs the target object with immense precision.This breakthrough in the imagery breaks their own record which was set in 2018 where they used a new detector to triple the resolution of an electron microscope. However, the previous iteration was limited to image only ultrathin samples that were only a few atoms thick.The new pixel array detector, loaded with more advanced 3D construction algorithms boosted the improvement by a factor of two. This resulted in an image with precision at the level of one picometre -- one trillionth of a metre.Also Read: New Hydrogen Atom-Based Storage Technology Lets You Fit 138TB On A Fingernail-Sized ChipDavid Muller of New York's Cornell University explains, By seeing how the pattern changes, we are able to compute the shape of the object that caused the pattern. With these new algorithms, we're now able to correct for all the blurring of our microscope to the point that the largest blurring factor we have left is the fact that the atoms themselves are wobbling.Representational Image: Getty ImagesAlso Read: NASA Created Fifth State Of Matter Inside The International Space StationHe further added, We want to apply this to everything we do. Until now, we've all been wearing really bad glasses. And now we actually have a really good pair. Why wouldn't you want to take off the old glasses, put on the new ones, and use them all the time?Researchers conclude that as of now even though the process is revolutionary, its quite time-consuming and computationally demanding. However, Mueller hopes that with advancements in computer and detector technology we could implement this more often in the future."

541419," May 28 is observed as Menstrual Hygiene Day across the world. The day is used to spread awareness about the need for menstrual hygiene and to reduce the stigma around conversations on the topic.The United Nations have called menstrual health is a human right, but a large section of women in the menstruating age group are deprived of this, due to the lack of resources and awareness.Menstrual health is a human right. Yet, menstruation can result in discrimination, stigma & exclusion against women & girls. More from on Fridays #MenstrualHygieneDay: poverty describes the struggle many low-income women and girls face while trying to afford menstrual products. The term also refers to the increased economic vulnerability women and girls face due the financial burden posed by menstrual supplies. These include not only sanitary napkins and tampons, but also related costs such as pain medication and underwear.UnsplashPeriod poverty does not only affect women and girls in developing countries; it also affects women in wealthy, industrialized countries.Difficulty affording menstrual products can cause girls to stay home from school and work, with lasting consequences on their educations and economic opportunities. It can also exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, pushing women and girls closer toward dangerous coping mechanisms.In India, the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdowns it has caused are adding to the period of poverty, especially in the rural areas where people have been left without even means to find food.In addition to the lack of menstrual hygiene products, women have also reported that they are increasingly experiencing irregular gaps in their menstrual cycle due to stress and anxiety every day.UnsplashThe Menstrual Hygiene Survey by Everteen, a feminine hygiene brand is observed annually on May 28, was conducted on nearly 5000 women in the age group of 18 to 35 years from Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Kolkata.Among other aspects of menstrual hygiene, this year's survey specifically aimed to gauge the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown in India on periods in women. The survey revealed that more than 41 per cent of women experienced an unusually irregular gap in their periods. This is startling because only 13.7 per cent of women who participated in the survey said they were infected with COVID-19.As many as 64.5 per cent of women said that the current COVID times had impacted their stress and anxiety levels, which could be a possible reason for irregularity in the gap between two menstrual periods in so many women.UnsplashOut of all the women who participated in the survey, 34.2 per cent, or more than one-third, said that they even noticed a change in intensity of menstrual flow, while 20 per cent of women said they missed their menstrual period at least once during this COVID phase. 29.2 per cent of women respondents claimed that they had more painful periods during COVID time than normal, while 28.8 per cent of women said that they noticed an unusual amount of clots in blood during the menstrual period.A disturbing finding was that 26.6 per cent of women did nothing about irregularity in their menstrual cycle dates, while another 35.4 per cent of women only discussed it with their mother or friends.Just 38 per cent of women chose to consult a doctor to evaluate why their menstrual cycle date was irregular. Similarly, 58.1 per cent of women said they had suffered from white discharge at some point in their menstruating life, but only 25.5 per cent of women consulted a doctor.Period cramps, cloth staining, and changing pads emerged as the top three concerns for women at 35.3 per cent, 30.8 per cent and 30.1 per cent respectively. Over 80 per cent of women admitted they had experienced staining during their periods. More than two-thirds of all women, 67.7 per cent to be exact, felt that girls avoid participating in sports or outdoor activities during their periods.Among other findings, the survey showed that 90.9 per cent of women still prefer to use sanitary napkins in India, while 7.3 per cent of women have switched to menstrual cups followed by 1 per cent tampon users.The survey showed that menstrual hygiene continues to shed its taboo image and is moving towards becoming a mainstream subject in Indian society. As many as 52.9 per cent of women felt that menstruation is perceived as a positive or neutral subject in India.Menstruation is not a dirty word. Let's talk about it! #MenstrualHygieneDay , nearly 36 per cent of women said that it was still considered taboo. Sharing their personal experiences, 58.1 per cent women said that they took it positively, while 1 per cent still found it a nuisance. A growing 16.8 per cent of women felt that there is no difference in perceptions about menstruation among men and women, although a majority 58 per cent still felt there was a difference in perceptions on the subject.UnsplashA healthy 40.2 per cent women said that men in the Indian society are able to relate to this natural process of the menstrual cycle, while another 48 per cent said that while men understand it, they are not able to relate to it fully."

The 1983 World Cup-winning captain added that India will have to take the game session by session since the weather in England changes within minutes.""India look a superior batting side. How they tackle the conditions is important. To me, India's batting will hold the key. The bowlers provide a solid back-up to India's cricket campaigns these days but the quality of batsmen will stand out in the final,"" Dev said.""Test cricket is about sessions.

So you have to be tactically good and technically sound when you play in England,"" he said in an interview to Mid-Day newspaper.BCCLThe 62-year-old warned Kohli against getting over-aggressive in England and felt that wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant has improved from the time he came into the side but still needs to be cautious in England.""I expect him (Kohli) to excel. Can you really shackle him? He is a natural when it comes to adapting but I would caution him to not be over-aggressive. He will have to measure it session by session. He'll be better off waiting for his moments of dominance. He will get his runs with a bit of patience,"" said Dev.""Trying too hard and too early doesn't work in England where you need to watch the movement of the ball. If you play seam and swing well, show patience, you will succeed in England.""He also said that Pant needs to spend time in the middle and get used to conditions before going for his shots.BCCL""He looks a very mature cricketer now from the time he came into the side. He seems to have far more time to play his shots and obviously his range of strokes is awesome. But England will be challenging. He must spend more time in the middle and not just look to hit every ball. We used to say the same about Rohit Sharma, who had so many shots, but would step out and get out so many times,"" said Dev.Dev had successful trips to England as captain.

541401," Bodies of people who have recovered from the novel coronavirus infection could be producing antibodies against the virus for months, according to a new study published in Nature.Getty ImagesAlso Read: This Man Has Super Antibodies, COVID-19's Worst NightmareResearchers from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, believe that immune cells in such bodies could persist for a lifetime, pushing out antibodies for years to come.Ali Ellebedy, associate professor of pathology and immunology of medicine and of molecular biology explains the notion surrounding the number of antibodies going down, Last fall, there were reports that antibodies wane quickly after infection with the virus that causes COVID-19, and mainstream media interpreted that to mean that immunity was not long-lived. But thats a misinterpretation of the data.He added, Its normal for antibody levels to go down after acute infection, but they dont go down to zero; they plateau. Here, we found antibody-producing cells in people 11 months after first symptoms. These cells will live and produce antibodies for the rest of peoples lives. Thats strong evidence for long-lasting immunity.Researchers saw that in a viral infection, immune cells that were responsible for producing the antibodies rapidly grew in number and circulated in the bloodstream, skyrocketing the levels of antibodies. But, after the infection was eliminated, most of these cells disappeared, causing a drop in antibodies.However, researchers say that a small percentage of antibody-producing cells migrate to the bone marrow and settle there, while continuously releasing low levels of antibodies in the blood, protecting us from getting infected again.Also Read: Three Months To Two Years: How Much Immunity Does Coronavirus Vaccine ProvideAccording to Ellebedy, the key to finding the answer to the question of long-lasting antibody protection lies in the bone marrow. He teamed up with Iskra Pusic, associate professor of medicine. They had enrolled 77 participants who were offering blood samples at three-month intervals from the first month after the initial infection. Most of its participants had a mild case with only six being hospitalised.Pusic helped in obtaining bone marrow samples from 18 of the participants seven to eight months after initial infections. Five came back after four months to give another bone marrow sample. For baseline, they got bone marrow samples from 11 individuals who never had COVID-19.Researchers in their results saw antibody levels in the blood drop as expected in the first few months and eventually levelled off, with some antibodies detectable even 11 months after the infection.Getty ImagesAlso Read: Israel Develops Antibody That Can Neutralize COVID-19 In Body, Will Begin Mass Production SoonOn the other hand, 15 out of the 19 bone marrow samples from people who had COVID-19 contained antibody-producing cells specifically to take down the novel coronavirus. These cells were even found four months later in five individuals who offered a second bone marrow sample. This was completely absent in the 11 individuals who never had COVID-19.People with mild cases of COVID-19 clear the virus from their bodies two to three weeks after infection, so there would be no virus driving an active immune response seven or 11 months after infection, Ellebedy said. These cells are not dividing. They are quiescent, just sitting in the bone marrow and secreting antibodies. They have been doing that ever since the infection resolved, and they will continue doing that indefinitely."
541400," Over the past couple of years, there has been a significant interest in Quantum Computing. It is one of the fast-emerging disruptive technology that can significantly impact many industries and societies. According to BCG analysis, the estimated impact (operating income) of Quantum computing will be $2-$5 billion by 2024, with a potential reach of up to $50 billion by the end of the decade.The technology is already witnessing exponential growth in its computing power as measured in ""Quantum Volume"" and is expected to grow further. The ""quantum advantage"" is likely to be realized in the next few years where real-world problems of consequence can be solved efficiently using a quantum computer that even the most giant supercomputer will not be able to achieve.IBMPotential applications span multiple sectors including finance, healthcare, manufacturing to supply-chain and logistics. For instance, in banking and finance quantum computing can be used to perform portfolio optimization, risk analysis and fraud detection more efficiently.ALSO READ: 'We Are 10 Years Away From A Chip That Will Change Our Life,' Says Intel's Quantum Computer GuyQuantum computing can also potentially simplify drug trials by simulating different drug compositions or perform more efficient diagnostics in life science and healthcare domain. In manufacturing, it can be used in designing batteries that can store more energy and in supply-chain and logistics it can be used to track global distributions and do more efficient routing, or predict systemic risks better.To begin with, fifty years of past learning from classical computing has to be incorporated to quicken the integration of quantum and classical systems. Quantum computing is not going to replace classical computing. Quantum computing is good with simulating other quantum systems, finding the lowest eigenvalue of a matrix or doing Monte-Carlo simulations more efficiently.In short, an application with a specific structure that is computationally intensive is likely to benefit from a quantum computer. This essentially means we will have a ""hybrid"" model where we will run some ""kernel"" of an application in quantum hardware while the application itself will run on classical hardware. This is much like using GPUs in the cloud for vector processing. The challenge is to identify those ""kernels"" that are likely to benefit from quantum hardware.Intel corporationQuantum computing is a technology born for the cloud; hence it is critical to mobilize developers to code worldwide for Quantum Computing through open-source communities. A big part of the software strategy is to create open-source tools that can be converted to first-class cloud-native components.ALSO READ: Sneak Peek Into Intel Labs To See What's Cooking In 2021 And BeyondIt is essential to scale and extend the quantum software to a larger community to take advantage of the architecture while running quantum programs securely and reliably. Users have begun to install and use some of the components from the software stack directly on the cloud architectures. In addition to the cloud-native deployment of quantum workloads, it is critical to break down any potential barriers and democratize access to this new technology.Forschungszentrum Jlich - Ralf-Uwe LimbachSimulations. Simulating a quantum system is one key value proposition of quantum computing and is particularly useful in the area of drug discovery. The pandemic has brought immense attention to the challenges of discovering a new drug. In general, a drug takes 10-15 years to discover and costs multi-billion dollars to go from development to a product. Simulating a complex molecule is not possible in a classical computer. The number of states required to keep track of all the molecules is humongous; furthermore, there can be many different combinations too in the drug discovery.Recent years has seen substantial development in both quantum hardware and algorithms. These advances have brought quantum computing closer to impending commercial utility. Drug discovery is one of the promising domains where these applications can enable faster and more accurate characterizations of molecular systems.Machine Learning. Quantum machine learning has a wide area of potential applications like finance, health science and manufacturing. Diagnostics in healthcare has a significant impact on patient outcome. It is becoming increasingly complex and expensive and some studies indicate error can be up to 25%. Mis-diagnostics can be quite costly not to mention deadly; for example, a study showed that early detection of colon cancer can improve survivability by 9X with 4X reduction in cost.Classification techniques are used in diagnostics like identifying if cells are cancerous or not, and quantum computing can potentially improve the quality of the results; other applications include medical image diagnostics too. In prediction, quantum computing can significantly improve structural predictions of complex structures like protein, DNA, RNA, etc. Algorithmic developments in quantum machine learning offer interesting alternatives to classical machine learning techniques, which may be helpful for the biochemical analyses involved in the early phases of drug discovery. Other applications include fraud detection in financial transactions, health insurance claims, risk prediction etc.IntelOptimization. As we saw recently during the pandemic, the supply and availability of oxygen became a huge issue. The technical challenge was how to get oxygen from where it is produced to where it is needed efficiently. These problems in general are computationally intractable, which means that they cannot be solved efficiently in a classical computer. Quantum optimization has the potential to explore the solution space more efficiently and is likely to produce better outcomes.This is an example of a broader area of supply chain and logistics where quantum computing is expected to make a big impact. Other potential application areas include portfolio optimization in financial services, graph problems like Max-Cut, network optimization in airlines, production yield improvement in semiconductor fabrication to name a few.In summary, quantum computing can drastically change the computing landscape in the coming decade, much like what GPUs did for AI in the previous decade. Quantum hardware is evolving very rapidly, and quantum software is maturing too. Many use-cases are being explored across many verticals like healthcare, life sciences, finance, supply chain/logistics, etc. These explorations are advancing just as rapidly and the goal is to be ready to take advantage of hardware as and when it is sufficiently powerful. These are exciting times, not only for the technology, but also for computing in general. We are on the cusp of a revolution, and it will be pretty interesting to see how this unfolds in the coming years.About the authors: Gargi Dasgupta is the Director, IBM Research India and CTO, IBM India and South Asia // Shesha Shayee Raghunathan is a Senior Engineer and IBM Quantum Distinguished Ambassador, IBM Systems"
541397," The richest man on the planet, Elon Musk is known for saying the most peculiar things at times. But it is a matter of sheer perception if the things he says are peculiar or are they actually genius. Well, his new words of wisdom are about dinosaurs. Yep, the Tesla owner is now going full on Jurassic Park on us. Yes, just like the movies time and again have told us viewers that dinosaurs can never get extinct and will always find a way into civilization, Elon Musk has his own theory that them that might have helped these medieval beasts from extinction altogether. In his latest reply to a meme about dinosaurs which he also posted by himself, he said that if the dinosaurs had a spaceship, they would still be around.If only they had spaceships, theyd still be aroundPeople of Twitter found it hilarious and some funny replies.Are you saying and massive extinction is coming up?Elon. Consider the near-perfect human specimens who could b the pioneers for life on another planet - Palestinians! 4 DECADES they've survived, even while imprisoned, minimal amounts of electricity, unclean H2O, loss of family/land/homes/food insecurity...But They Survived!Maybe the opposite. They had spaceships & left :)To be honest, this comment about spaceships didn't seem quite weird to us considering that Musk has been hell bent on taking humans to Mars and spaceships pretty much might be the only ""transport"" that might make his plan come to reality. However, many people and including Bill Gates have rubbished Musk's solution of colonializing Mars. Many climate activists have also dissed the Tesla owner for not trying make Earth a better place to live rather than finding ways to colonialize a barren planet with no life. But who knows. Maybe Musk is trying to say that just like dinosaurs humanity might not live forever, unless we can find another planet to colonize."

541392," Ubisoft just dropped the much-awaited gameplay video for the newest instalment in the Far Cry franchise -- Far Cry 6.UbisoftThe franchise, with this game, is steering to a new dystopian world of Yara which is in control of a merciless dictator Anton Castillo. His vision is to turn Yara into his own version of a paradise, in a place that many could synonymize as hell on Earth.The story is about Anton Castillo and his war against the revolutionaries, the guerilla freedom fighters who want him to step down, while he prepares his son, 13-year-old Diego to be the next to take the throne.We got to interact with Navid Khavari, the Narrative Director of Far Cry 6 and understand his vision for the game and how he created this remarkable and vivid story.Navid Khavari - UbisoftIn case you didnt already know, the antagonist of this story -- Anton Castillo -- is played by none other than Giancarlo Esposito who has been known for his iconic roles in shows like Breaking Bad, The Boys and most recently, the Mandalorian.If youve been an avid fan of the franchise you know a good Far Cry villain is the most important, and seeing Giancarlos limited shots in the teaser and trailers, it surely seems like we are in for a painful treat. I was curious to know what was the secret sauce in Navids mind while crafting the perfect antagonist for the Far Cry franchise and how Giancarlos character was brought to fruition.UbisoftThe secret sauce for Anton was looking at what a dictator is like or what they might be like, you know if you're in their living room if you're at their kitchen table, what are they like when their guard is down?, said Navid, and so that was really, just a fascinating idea to me because it allows you to see how they, you know, go through those steps? How do they justify the twisted things that they're doing?Khavari shared how Giancarlo was perfect for the character of Anton, When we were looking at who to cast, who would fit Anton, when we met with Giancarlo, in New York, it was like the floodgates opened. He had extensive notes on what we were doing and he instantly got it. We talked a lot about the idea of family, as you know, this is a father and a son at the heart of what's going on in the narrative and, and so, he wanted to invest stuff that he wanted to really drill down into what is.UbisoftHe added how invested Giancarlo got with the character of Anton, You know, Anton and Diego have a complicated relationship, but Anton loves his son and his son loves him back. So I think making that personal sort of investment, that personal motivation, that justification, and then translating that into this massive open world and how Anton takes that and twists into justifying incredible horrors, was really fascinating for myself and for Giancarlo.Normally Far Cry games have truly been about survival, whether it was saving yourself from Vaass insanity in Far Cry 3 or running away from a toxic cult in Far Cry 5. However, with Far Cry 6, this aspect of survival also has a flavour of politics with a dictator like Anton and how he rose to power, so I was curious to know how deep this influence goes in the games story.UbisoftI'm of the view that everything is political, right? I think we were really looking at what are the commonalities you find, in revolutions, and in guerilla revolution. So the themes emerge. You know how systemic oppression is used to keep a population down. How censorship is used to keep a population down to keep people sort of manipulate them and with that comes a complicated sort of narrative.Khavari shared how this helped them create unique characters that embraced the complexity, We didn't want to hide from that. We wanted to sort of embrace the complexity and it really boils down to character. You know, Far Cry has a history of rich characters. And in Far Cry 6, we wanted our characters to have their own persona.He added, We wanted them to have their own opinions about the revolution and that's, it's a discourse that they're in, where some, you know, agree with, with what the guerilla is doing some absolutely don't, you know, and even within the guerillas themselves, some of them are willing to go maybe a little too far as opposed to others. So that sort of complexity is really important, I think, for any modern narrative. And it's absolutely important for Far Cry 6.UbisoftNavid shared how the game has included several elements that Far Cry franchise fans would truly feel at home with, as well as a bunch of new inclusions that theyll truly love, I think there are certain things that the fans are going to recognize immediately -- we're bringing Fangs For Hire back and we've just given a small tease of the roster that's coming with, Guapo our lovable, crocodile that easts soldiers and Chorizo our lovable sausage dog.Navid shared some new gameplay elements that players would be excited to try, There's going to be these exciting new elements like the concept of making do with what you're happy with, what you have translated to guerrilla resolve.UbisoftHe shared that even the weapons that you use in this game arent going to be basic, they will be handcrafted DIY that would have a character of its own, When Juan Cortez, our sort of spymaster DIY inventor, hands, you a gun, you can see the history of that gun, how it was constructed, you know, with sardine cans, nails, a gas pump.He spoke about a unique sense of personalisation in the gameplay that wasnt seen before in previous Far Cry games, Even the guerilla rides are customisable to create chaos. That on top of guerrilla camps -- this notion of these safe spaces, where you can blow off some steam, play some dominoes mini-games and meet other quest givers and then go out into the world.UbisoftAnother cool inclusion is the ability to put down the weapon to just explore the vast, beautiful open world. Weve included this notion of being able to holster your weapon as well so you can navigate the world and just enjoy the beauty that our team has as invested and put in the game. So there's definitely those elements that are tried and true and part of the franchise, but there's a lot of fun.Khavari shared how the inspiration of including the concept of horse riding in this instalment came while they were researching for the game in Cuba, It was one of the things we found when we visited Cuba. We actually got to do a bit of horse riding. Even when you look at the sort of those old guerilla photos, the notion of horses, the notion of being able to sort of navigating a world this way was really exciting.He added, The horses are going to be able to kind of navigate through areas, a little bit more discreetly, let's say than, than. your regular vehicles will. God, there's no better feeling for me. It's actually my favourite way to get around in the game and, and feel the virtual wind in my hair, so I think players are going to be really excited about it.If youve seen the trailers or gameplay videos, Im sure you would have come across this adorable sausage dog that had wheels instead of its hindlegs -- Chorizo. I was excited to know what was the idea that brought it to fruition.UbisoftYou know Chorizo was actually born from the idea of what if we have a character in the game who has a dog, said Navid, and we wanted a nice, cute dog -- that kind of thing. And the concept artists came back with Chorizo and this notion of a dog that also kind of represents this unique philosophy, like he's got wheels and also has tools.Honestly, when the concept art came out, literally, the next day everyone's wallpaper was Chorizo, so, it really came from the team, it was an unbelievable, effort, and then that inspired even the notion of, how to bring something interesting to the Fangs for Hire element where Chorizo is all about killing the bad guys with kindness.These words and insight from Ubisoft's Navid Khavari has set up Far Cry 6 perfectly for us, and we can't wait to have a crack at the game. Far Cry 6 releases on Oct 7, 2021, and it will be available on all major online and offline retailers in India, with prices as follows: Far Cry 6 Yara Edition - 3,999 (PS5, PS4, Xbox One); Far Cry 6 Gold Edition - 6,299 (PS4, Xbox One), Far Cry 6 Ultimate Edition - 6,999 (PS4, Xbox One)."

Protecting free speech in India is not the prerogative of a for-profit foreign entity like Twitter but it is the commitment of the worlds largest democracy and its robust institutions.The Government of India states that Twitter with its statements is trying to dictate its terms to the worlds largest democracy while also undermining the nations legal system. It also stated that Twitter failed to comply with the regulations listed in the intermediary guidelines that allow the platform to harbour protection from any criminal liability.The Government of India also asked Twitter why it didnt set up a mechanism of its own in India when it was so committed towards Indian citizens. The release addressed the problem that Twitter lacked authority and that issues faced by Indian citizens had to be reported to Twitter HQ in the US, stating that the commitment that Twitter talks about not just sounds hollow but is also completely self-serving.Also Read: WhatsApp Sues Indian Govt, Claims New Intermediary Rules Would End User PrivacyReutersThe press release states that the new rules empower the ordinary users who become victims of defamation, morphed images, sexual abuse and the whole range of other abusive content in blatant violation of law, to seek redress.The release also highlights that the rules were finalised after a series of consultations which included the representatives of social media platforms. MeitY had put the draft of the rules in the public domain while seeking public comments on the same.These rules were drafted after various judicial orders from courts across the nation including the Supreme Court of India that directed the government to take necessary steps. Additionally, these rules were a result of several parliamentary debates and recommendations.Also Read: India Could Block Facebook, Twitter, Instagram From May 26: Here's WhyAddressing the issue surrounding the freedom of speech and right to speech, the Government of India said, Freedom of Speech and Expression is a fundamental right under the Indian constitution. The Government of India respects the right of the people to ask questions and also criticise on these social media platforms, including on Twitter. The government equally respects the right to privacy.The Government of India, however, stated how the only instance where free speech was shut down was by Twitter on its platform, However, the only instance of scuttling free speech on Twitter is Twitter itself and its opaque policies, as a result of which peoples accounts are suspended and tweets are deleted arbitrarily without recourse.The Government of India, in its next power play move, asked Twitter to stop beating around the bush and comply with the laws of the land.It further went on to say that Lawmaking and policy of the formulations is the sole prerogative of the sovereign and Twitter is just a social media platform and it has no locus in dictating what Indias legal policy framework should be.ReutersIn a series of examples, the Government of India spoke about how Twitter was almost invisible in its commitment towards Indian citizens. It stated instances of Twitter showing geo-location of certain locations in the Union Territory of Ladakh as a part of the Peoples Republic of China, which was fixed after several reminders and showed blatant disrespect to Indias sensitivity and territorial integrity.It also gave examples of when the Government had asked Twitter to take down or block content during the unlawful incidents at the Red Fort, New Delhi, and it responded to comply long after the damage was done.It also spoke about spreading harmful content spreading on its platform including vaccine hesitancy as well as discriminatory practices by malicious tagging of B.1.617 mutant as the Indian Variant even after WHOs guidelines against it.Concluding its statements, the Government of India stated that it wishes to emphatically assure that representatives of social media companies in India including Twitter are and will always remain safe in India and there is no threat to their personal safety and security.It added that it condemned the unfortunate statement issued by Twitter as totally baseless, false and an attempt to defame India to hide their own follies."
541387," A team of scientists in the UK have successfully tested a novel concept that could help pave the way in developing commercially viable power from nuclear fusion (according to a report by LBC).PAAlso Read: Bill Gates And Jeff Bezos Back Startup For Unlimited Clean Energy Via Nuclear FusionFusion energy is created using a machine called tokamak -- a fusion power station that heats a gas or plasma causing types of hydrogen fuel to fuse together and release energy to be converted into electricity.The most challenging part about tokamaks is the heat they produce during fusion reactions. Without the presence of a capable exhaust system, materials would get damaged and require replacement regularly, increasing the cost and amount of time a power plant could operate at.However, the new system developed by researchers dubbed Super-X diverter enables the components in tokamaks to last longer than expected. According to the researchers, this could boost the economic viability while also bringing the cost of fusion electricity down.Also Read: Scientists Steady Plasma At 50 Million Degrees, Promise Nuclear Fusion Energy SoonResearchers have been conducting tests at MAST Upgrade at Culham, near Oxford since October last year which has shown a good ten-fold reduction in heat on materials with the Super-X system. Researchers claim this could revolutionise fusion plant creation and offer affordable and efficient electricity.UKAEA (UK Atomic Energy Authority) is working on building a prototype by the early 2040s which will be called as STEP. This would be made using a compact machine dubbed spherical tokamak.PAAlso Read: New Diamond Battery Will Last 28,000 Years, Powered By Nuclear WasteUKAEA's lead scientist at MAST Upgrade, Dr Andrew Kirk, said: ""These are fantastic results. They are the moment our team at UKAEA has been working towards for almost a decade. We built MAST Upgrade to solve the exhaust problem for compact fusion power plants, and the signs are that we've succeeded.He added, ""Super-X reduces the heat on the exhaust system from a blowtorch level down to more like you'd find in a car engine. This could mean it would only have to be replaced once during the lifetime of a power plant. It's a pivotal development for the UK's plan to put a fusion power plant on the grid by the early 2040s - and for bringing low-carbon energy from fusion to the world."""

541384," Obesity has nearly tripled since 1975 and it kills more people than underweight. Overweight and obesity are defined as excessive or abnormal fat accumulation that may lead to many potentially serious diseases. As per studies, over 1.9 billion are overweight and 650 million are obese worldwide.Due to sedentary lifestyle and large consumption of fast foods and processed foods, people are facing high risk of obesity and their adverse consequences. Above 135 million individuals are affected by obesity in India alone. These statistics become even more alarming at a time when second wave of COVID-19 has prompted a new battle for India.AFPAs per Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, obesity may triple the risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection, is linked to impaired immune system and decreases lung capacity. People with obesity also have an increased amount of cholesterol in their bile, which increases the risk of gall stones.ALSO READ: Weight Loss Tips - Common Mistakes To AvoidOn this World Digestive Health Day, let us raise awareness about obesity and its impact on the development of comorbidities, one of which is gallstones.Developed in the gallbladder, gallstones are hardened deposits of digestive fluid. To help in digestion, the gallbladder holds and releases a fluid made in the liver called bile.Gallstones are solid masses from bile precipitates. There are 2 types of gallstones. 1. Cholesterol and 2. Pigment. Cholesterol stones predominantly found in women and obese people, are associated with bile supersaturated with cholesterol. They account for 80 percent of gall stones and are more commonly involved in obstruction and inflammation.Gallstones form when the bile hardens into pieces of solid material. Gallstones block bile duct causing pain that requires urgent medical intervention.ShutterstockGallbladder problems cause pain on the right side or middle of the upper belly, back and in the tip of the right shoulder blade and may get worse after a heavy meal. Other symptoms include vomiting, nausea, chills, and fever.ALSO READ: Weight Loss Tips - Start Race WalkingFactors that may increase the risk of gallstones include being a female, age 40 or older, overweight or obese, sedentary lifestyle, pregnancy, high-fat diet, high-cholesterol diet, low-fibre diet, family history of gallstones, diabetes, certain blood disorders, such as sickle cell anaemia or leukaemia, liver disease and taking medications that contain estrogen.When one experiences the symptoms and signs of gallstones, it is critical to visit the doctor. The doctor may recommend tests used to diagnose gallstones include blood tests and imaging like abdominal ultrasound or endoscopic ultrasound.healthifymeInitially medical management were tried with not much benefits. Attempts to dissolve the gall stone with ursodeoxycholic acid or direct instillation of ether into the gall bladder were tried. But the recurrence of gall stones after stopping therapy is one of the main drawbacks.Now at present, removal of gall bladder is the treatment of choice for symptomatic gall stone disease. However, patients with gallstones with stones blocking the bile duct can be treated with endoscopic therapy.APEndoscopic Retrograde CholangioPancreatography (ERCP) is a technique where an endoscope is passed into the second part of duodenum. Using a guide wire, the bile duct is cannulated, and the stone is removed using a stone retrieval balloon or a basket. It is simple, cost effective and can be done as a day care procedure.Earlier Patients with bile duct stone more than 2 cm or more required surgery. As medical science as evolved over the years, we now have enhanced instruments such as Cholangioscopy that eliminate the need for surgery.The direct visualisation of the bile ducts during the procedure enables better control of instruments used to remove stones and laser lithotripsy can be done to fragment the stones and remove it easily. Now a days stone size is a not a contraindication for ERCP. Cholangioscopy can also help in differentiating between malignant and benign masses.IstockToday, when scientific breakthroughs and minimally invasive procedures are bringing respite to millions of patients, let us not forget that adopting healthy lifestyle can go a long way in managing problems like gallstones. One can reduce the risk of gallstones if they do not skip meals, lose weight slowly, eat more high-fibre foods and maintain a healthy weight.About the authors: Dr. Vinoth Kumar, Senior Consultant and Clinical Lead at GEM Hospital, Chennai and Dr. Nivesh Seehra, Consultant Physician and Gastroenterologist at Siddhanta Red Cross Super Specialty Hospital, Bhopal.

I don't want to tell people to be positive and ignore the painful reality of pain, trauma and loss. That is nothing but toxic positivity. At the same time, The KINDry will not be about fluffy pink clouds and unicorns, but incidents actually happening around us which don't get amplified as much as they ought to.""People also deserve to hear stories of real-life heroes. We will start small and we hope to build a community or strengthen existing ones. The idea is to celebrate unsung heroes who you read about only in passing. While responding to SOS appeals on social media, I realized ordinary citizens are working day and night to procure life-saving drugs, beds, oxygen for people they've never met. We have seen a truly bipartisan effort, where temporarily people have forgotten even their ideological differences and come through to help each other. This gives me hope and I want to share these hopeful stories which are rooted in reality. We must deliberately amplify the good, to ease the pain of real news. It is clear that what will see us through this phase, is the kindness of strangers,"" she said in a statement.The Kindry celebrates the kindness of common people."

541329," Researchers in Denmark have now developed a way to use grass fibres to create packaging for fast food, replacing the harmful plastic and reducing CO2 emissions.Getty ImagesAlso Read: Scientists Create World's 1st Truly Biodegradable Plastic That Breaks Apart In DaysOn average, over 10,000 tons of takeaway food packaging is used in Denmark and most of it uses plastic, which due to its non-biodegradable nature is harmful for the environment.The project is dubbed SinProPack and with this initiative, the researchers are aiming to reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 210 kilotons and 10 kilotons of disposable plastic packaging along with 8 kilotons of grass fibre-based paper for the packaging.Green biomass is abundantly available in Denmark with green biorefining for protein production already being something people have been interested in.Assistant Professor Morten Ambye-Jensen from the Department of Biological and Chemical Engineering at Aarhus University, who is developing this novel technique, explained that theyd first harvest the grass and extract the protein for animal feed. After this, it would allow them to refine and pulp the grass fibres for cellulose using which packaging can be produced.He added, In this way, we can use and up-value a side stream from protein production. It's a great way to create added value for biorefining, as not all grass fibre can necessarily be used as cattle feed.Also Read: Pineapple Leaves Turned Into Tiny Drones That Are Lighter, Sturdier & BiodegradableThe researchers highlighted that they wont just be relying on grass, but theyd also look at clover for fibre sources. These can be used as the primary biomass for future biorefineries. Another source theyre looking for biomass is from peat soil that promises to add more fibre and less protein.Getty ImagesAlso Read: Food Containers Made Of Seaweed Aim To Replace Plastic And Reduce PollutionAnne Christine Steenkjr Hastrup, centre director at Danish Technological Institute, said in a statement, Disposable packaging made of grass brings a lot of environmental benefits. The packaging will be 100% biodegradable, so if someone accidentally drops their packaging in nature, it will decompose naturally.To bring this initiative to fruition, the project has received 440,000 Euros in funding from the Danish Environmental Protection Agency, under the program for Green Development and Demonstration (GUDP). The project is expected to be completed in 2023."

ZRC-3308, a cocktail of two SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can emerge as one of the main treatments for mild COVID 19,"" Cadila Healthcare said in a regulatory filing.BCCLAccording to the company ZRC-3308 has been found to be safe, shown to reduce lung damage and well-tolerated in animal toxicology studies.Zydus said it is the only Indian company to have developed a neutralizing monoclonal antibody-based cocktail for the treatment of COVID-19.The therapy is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies, which mimic natural antibodies that the body generates to fight infection.AFPThe company said ZRC-3308 reduced the SARS-CoV-2-mediated damage to the lungs and has reduced immune-effector functions to minimise potential tissue-damaging side effects of virus neutralising monoclonal antibodies thereby providing a safer product.Monoclonal antibodies act like natural antibodies by binding and destroying SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Neutralising monoclonal antibody-based treatments have received emergency use authorisation in mild COVID-19 in the US, Europe and India because they significantly reduce viral load in mild patients and their rate of hospitalisation.""At this juncture, there is a critical need to explore safer and more efficacious treatments to combat COVID. It is important to look at different stages of disease progression and look at options that can reduce patients suffering and discomfort,"" the statement, tweeted by the company said.AFPIf approved ZRC-3308 will be the second antibody cocktail that will be cleared for use in India.Regeneron and Roche's antibody cocktail has also received emergency use approval in India, and will be distributed by drugmaker Cipla. The first batch of the cocktail became available in the country earlier this week.The drug, which will come in packs of two doses, will cost Rs 59,750 per dose for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate symptoms.In addition to the cocktail, Zydus Cadila is also developing a COVID-19 vaccine of its own.AFP/ REPRESENTATIONAL IMAGENamed ZyCoV-D, the vaccine candidate was cleared for human trial by DCGI in July 2020 and is expected to be available in the market by June 2021.The company had recently said that it is looking to increase monthly production of ZyCoV-D to up to 30 million doses in four to five months, from 10 million now."

When she tried to get to the bottom of this, she realized that many parents are trying to stay afloat and due to job losses and pay cuts, they are not able to pay their children's fees.Pillai initially discounted 25% of the annual fees, however, families from the weaker sections still couldn't pay the fees. ""We have children of daily wagers and lower-middle-class families studying with us. The worry was that girl students would be the first to be forced to drop out of school."" Pillai told TOI.Careers 360Just so that no one child has to drop out, Pillai took matters into her own hand and through local community networks and social media platforms she started approaching corporates to sponsor children's education.""It took a while for corporates to respond. I am glad the effort is bearing fruit. Around 200 students fees have been paid with the collected funds. We are now looking at sponsors for our students for the academic year of 2021-22."" Pillai told TOI.BlogspotThe school has told the students to remain stress-free about the fees and just focus on their studies. These students are truly blessed to have an educator like this."

541292," Sometimes animals do the most amusing things that get us humans surprised like hell. But have you seen honey bees doing something extraordinary other than making honey and well, stinging people? Well, a new video has emerged where honey bees have ended up doing something totally brilliant. In this video, which has gone viral now from So Paulo, Brazil, two honey bees work together to lift the top off a bottle of Fanta. The entire process is pretty entertaining. The two bees initially position themselves on either side of the bottle. They then use their legs to push the cap up and only after a few seconds, the bees manage to lift the top off the soda bottle and it falls on the ground.Two bees opening a soda bottle together..  to the person who filmed this video, it was taken by him during his lunch break. He got a bottle of soda but the bees stole it and started doing this amazing task. People are obviously astonished after watching this video and can't get over it.We are SOOOO wrong when we claim that insects have no intelligence.Wed be really screwed if animals were any smarter than they areif they can build and maintain honeycomb in a beehive, surely they can open a Fanta  especially when the lid is loose already (pressure off) and they smell the tonnes of sugar for miles  moreover: animals basically are smarter than Hoomans! ANOTHER example of animals showing us the way. Teamwork makes the dream work. And I bet there was nary a thought in either brain as to what was in it for them. They just knew they had to work together for a COMMON goal. And we call animals (insects, etc.) dumb?We surely give animals less credit than they deserve."

541285," Nearly three weeks after three women belonging to the same family filed a rape case against a self-styled godman, Rajasthan police arrested Yogendra Mehta, as per TNN. Mehta has a sprawling ashram on the Jaipur-Ajmer highway.The main complainant plus two of her sisters-in-law filed the FIR on May 4. They alleged he repeatedly raped them in his ashram between 2005 and 2017. A day after the FIR, another woman said she too was raped by Mehta, and her name was added in the complaint.My husband had been a regular visitor at the ashram since 1998. Mehta had one day asked my husband to come with his entire family and thats how I was introduced to him in 2005. Then I started visiting the ashram regularly. Initially, everything was fine and I used to stay at the ashram for three-four days every six months. During one such stay in 2005, I was called by the aides of the accused to his room. Once I was there, I was given some spiked drink and raped. Mehta repeatedly raped me in the ashram till 2017, she said in her complaint, adding that her sisters-in-law were similarly exploited.PTIEvery time I objected, Mehta told me its a blessing and threatened me with dire consequences if I told anyone about his sexual misconduct, she said, adding that she was forced to confide in her husband only when the godman wanted their 20-year-old daughter to stay at the ashram for a few days.The other complainant added in the FIR said she too was raped by Mehta many times during the same period. Not just she, the accused and his aides used to make eight-ten women stay at the ashram for getting raped. Mehtas aides are equally responsible as it is they who gave spiked drinks to the victims before raping them, she said.Sources said that Mehtas arrest was not easy since many politicians and influential people were regulars at his ashram.PTISHO Mukesh Choudhary of Bhakrota police station, under which the ashram falls, said in the past three weeks he collected evidence against Mehta and then called him to the police station on Tuesday for recording his statement, before arresting him.The investigation has started.

She has proved her acting mettle in films like Love Sonia, Super 30 and Batla House.TwitterTwitterIndiatimes got candid with this talented actress and spoke to her about her journey. To begin with, we asked Mrunal about the success she desired and got and she said,Yes, I always dreamt of this of where I am today. But this is just the beginning; there is a long way to go. Desires are something that always pushes you to do better in life. My only agenda is to be a part of the cinema till the last breath of my life. Because I feel I am only good at this. I am thankful of this journey, its beautiful and overwhelming.Mrunal who is taking it one day at a time gave all the credit to Vidya Balan for making space for actresses like her,I think a lot of credit goes to Vidya Balan and other actresses like Taapse Pannu, because of them, the opportunities have opened up. They took the risk in their career and it is inspiring for actors like us.Also, important to me is the quality and not the quantity of work. Of course I want to earn bread and butter, but I dont want to do films for the heck of money. Because if I start doing that, I will have to compromise in the roles I do , for me its like an artist needs to surrender his or her soul and I will not be able to do that if I am not doing something substantial.""A post shared by Mrunal Thakur ()Having no godfather and no big surname its tough to survive in this industry, but Mrunal didnt give and made it. Talking about her low days, she said,I wanted to give up not because its not my cup of tea, I never lost faith in myself. I always knew that I am born for bigger things. I told myself that its peoples job to devalue and reminded to value myself and be a part of this race. There were times where I questioned myself whether I am not good enough, but I always took the rejection. I told myself sometimes I didnt fit the bill and its okay.A post shared by Mrunal Thakur ()Talking about the fear of being typecast after taking the role of Sonia in Love Sonia, she said,""Unfortunately in our industry we all want to play safe, because somebody has been playing a rural girl they will offer me only that, because se they have seen me pull it off, but that time I have to stay strong as an actor and refuse the roles which was very similar to Love Sonia.I never wanted to typecast myself but saying no was also tough, because actors think that there is no work and whatever you are getting you should do , with me it wasnt like that at all. I am very happy doing laundry at home if I dont get the work I want to do"".A post shared by Mrunal Thakur ()We asked how difficult it was to say no to the roles that were very similar to Love Sonia,I was jobless; there was no money I was earning. I almost sat for 2 and half years at home without work. I was doing absolutely nothing at all. Fortunately my father backed me up. If I would be a guy and I had to run a family, it would be very very difficult for me. So, yes it was difficult, I was completely broke, I could not take care of my diet which was getting very expensive, so there were times I would eat whatever was available and had to work out twice because there was no other option.But still I never thought of doing any film for money because the moment I will do that I know I am going to lose myself.A post shared by Mrunal Thakur ()The girl indeed has high aspirations and we love that about her. Mrunal will be next seen in Toofan starring Farhan Akhtar and Jersey alongside Shahid Kapoor."

Singh was given the drug over 30-minute intravenous supply on Tuesday at Medanta, Gurugram.The first batch of the Roche drug with two antibodies  Casirivimab and Imdevimab  reached India on Monday. This drug is different from convalescent plasma and entirely different from repurposed drugs like Remdesivir or Tocilizumab, Dr Naresh Trehan, director, Medanta, said.Studies show that 80% of patients who took this drug did not need hospitalisation. It also reduced the death rate in addition to shortening the duration of symptoms.

541256," As India is struggling to keep its COVID-19 vaccination drive going amid the acute shortage of the two domestically made doses and the limited supply of the imported Sputnik V jabs, there is some good news for the country.American pharma giant Pfizer has reportedly made its proposal to supply its COVID-19 vaccines to India.BCCLAccording to a report in The Economic Times, Pfizer has sought a firm pre-order along with advance payment for supplying COVID-19 vaccines to India on the same lines as other countries which have opted to procure vaccines from the company.The company, in its meetings with the top officials in India has assured that it will share latest technology needed for co-production if the deal were to materialise, including research and modifications to cope with variants of virus as they evolve.A PTI report said that Pfizer is ready to offer 5 crore shots in 2021 itself but it wants significant regulatory relaxations including indemnification.FileThe company has promised 1 crore doses in July, 1 crore in August, 2 crore in September and 1 crore in October and made it clear that it will deal only with the Government of India and payment for vaccines will have to be made by GOI to Pfizer India.Earlier, Punjab and Delhi which were trying to procure the vaccines on their own were told by both Pfizer and Moderna that they won't be able to supply the doses as the companies only deal with central governments.Meanwhile, it has been reported that Moderna has told the Indian government that it does not have surplus vaccines to share in 2021, and supply will only be possible in 2022.ReutersModerna is eyeing to launch a single-dose COVID-19 vaccine in India next year and is in talks with Cipla among other Indian firms.Currently, the country is using two ""made-in India"" jabs Covishield and Covaxin and has administered 20 crore doses since launching the world's largest vaccination drive in mid-January. A third vaccine, Russian-made Sputnik V, has been approved by the government and is being used on a smaller scale at present.With the vaccine drive not able to keep up pace with the demand, last month the Indian government had relaxed norms for foreign-made vaccines.AgenciesThis means that the pre-condition for foreign manufacturers to undertake phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials in India for those vaccines that have already been granted approvals by relevant regulatory bodies in the US, the European Union, the United Kingdom and Japan as well as by the World Health Organisation will be waived off."
541255," Cyclone Yaas has made landfall today at around 10:30 AM on Wednesday, and according to the Indian Meteorological Department, the full-moon perigean that our world is currently experiencing could also result in increased damage.APAlso Read: Moon Disappeared For Months In 1110: Scientists May Have Solved This 910-Year-Old MysteryThis is according to Sanib Banerjee, deputy director of IMD Kolkata in a conversation with the Hindustan Times. He says that the damage would be mostly seen in the coastal districts of East Midnapore and South 24 Parganas.IMD deputy director explained that due to the full-moon perigee, it would result in the rise of sea level by at least a metre -- a phenomenon thats known as spring tide and is seen during the full moon. This rise is over the normal high tide that the sea would witness on a daily basis.When the moon aligns with the perigee and is at the closest point in the Earths orbit, we witness the supermoon where the Moon appears quite larger than it normally does.However, during this time, the gravitational pull of the Moon is also the strongest, this causes the tides to rise much higher and much lower than normal. This phenomenon is known as a spring tide.The IMD deputy warned that the storm surge caused by the cyclone in East Midnapore district would be two to four metres whereas in South 24 Parganas it would be around one to two metres. This is over and above the spring tide.Also Read: 10 Years Of Moon Pics: NASA Explains Why Moon Shines In Red, Blue And Even PurpleWhat also makes this supermoon special is the lunar eclipse that the world is experiencing today, putting quite a show for avid skywatchers.ReutersAlso Read: Earth Will Have A Second Moon From October To May, Completely Human MadeThe eclipse is expected to commence today, at 2:17 PM (Indian Standard Time) and will last about five hours.For people who are only concerned about the total phase of the eclipse, thatll commence at 4:55 PM (Indian Standard Time)."

541251," Today when you hear about Vimeo, some of you guys remember it as a YouTube competitor whereas most of you might not even know what it is.Getty ImagesFor people who do know and have ever used Vimeo's video service, youll know that it wasnt really a good alternative. And over the years Vimeo suffered severe losses, making it difficult for the company to survive, losing ground to YouTube, Netflix and others.However, one woman helped in changing the companys performance to an extent that Vimeo has gone public. Meet Anjali Sud, CEO of Vimeo, who made all this happen, who rescued Vimeo from disaster to getting it listed on NASDAQ yesterday.Today is a public company. It has been a 16-year labor of love, rooted in our belief in the power of video. We put creators first, and put that power in the hands of millions.To everyone who made today possible: Thank you  Now we keep building. #VMEO Read: Whitney Wolfe Herd Is Youngest Self-Made CEO Billionaire To Take Her Company PublicAnjali Sud was born in an Indian-immigrant family residing in Detroit, Michigan in 1983. In the year 1997, she left Flint to study at the Phillips Andover Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. She completed her B.Sc in Finance and Management from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 2005, followed by an MBA from Harvard Business School in 2011.During the years 2005 and 2014 she worked in roles of finance, media and e-commerce at Sagent Advisors, Amazon and Time Warner, before shifting to Vimeo in 2014.Anjali joined Vimeo in 2014 when the company was around 12 years old. This was also a time when the company was busy competing with YouTube and Netflix -- both tech giants who were at their peak (and probably still are) -- and provide a higher quality alternative.Getty ImagesIn a conversation with Nilay Patel of The Verge, she revealed how the company was heavily curating content for its platform as well as investing in their own content too. However, she felt that they werent going to compete with original content in Netflix as it would require them to spend $17 billion on it. Also, YouTube was regarded as a one-stop solution for entertainment and people always chose YouTube like a hard to break habit.Also Read: Tim Cook Says He Won't Be Apple CEO For 10 More Years, Despite Feeling GreatShe thought of looking at a new direction to shift Vimeo from an entertainment and content platform to a platform that provided tools to help small content creators and businesses to make videos.In a conversation with Forbes, she stated that she wanted to do with video what Squarespace and GoDaddy did for websites -- allowing smaller businesses to get into the digital world with minimal technical know-how.She pitched this idea directly to CEO of Vimeos parent company Joey Levin. Levin liked the idea and in no time she assembled a small team to begin her idea.In no time the software solution was ready and as soon as the services went live, they saw a significant improvement in the revenue than the year before. In 2020, Vimeo reported sales of $84 million -- 54 percent higher than the same time last year. Today the platform has over 200 million users with 1.5 million paid users. She was appointed as CEO in 2017.TechCrunchAlso Read: WeWork CEO Says Only Less Engaged Employees Prefer Work From HomeIn November 2018, Sud was named #14 on Fortunes 2018 40 under 40 list.

541246," The much-dreaded landfall of very severe cyclonic storm Yaas began south of Balasore in Odisha Wednesday morning. The landfall process will last for three-four hours.More than 4,000 personnel in 52 units of the National Disaster Response Force, 60 Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force, 200 fire service teams and 86 tree cutting units have been pressed into service.According to the State SRC, 860 permanent shelters and 6,031 additional shelters which collectively could accommodate 7.5 lakh people have been identified.Despite the efforts by disaster management authorities, people in the coastal regions have pinned their hopes on dense mangrove forests to ward off the damage and offer protection from the cyclone.Bhitarkarnika Wildlife Sanctuary, Odisha/Smitha G S, Own WorkLocals are exuding optimism that the rich mangrove forest cover along the wetland sites of the park would again turn into a saviour for them.Everybody here is confined indoors either in homes or cyclone shelters. The forest cover around had protected us with minimal damage in past cyclones. We pray forest withstands the onslaught this time also,"" said Ganesh Chandra Gudia who lives in Talchua village beside the Bhitarkanika National Park in Kendrapara district.The district is close to Dhamra port, where the landfall took place this morning.The national park had withstood the onslaught of cyclone Amphan that had barrelled through coastal Odisha in May last year.Yaas cyclone: Quite disturbing visuals coming from Baliapal, Balasore . Villages got submerged. My prayer for our people . #yaas #odisha The coastal woodland has the capacity to withstand wind speed up to 20 kilometre per hour. We are scared but hopeful that nature will arrest the stormy onslaught,"" Nrusingha Behera, a resident of Nalitapatia village said. The luxuriant mangrove cover often acts as a protective barrier against cyclone and tidal surge.Bhitarkanika is a rich storehouse of mangrove genes. Researchers have come across 11 of the 70 mangrove species, which were at elevated threat of extinction in the world, in the national park.Odisha is endowed with a reserve of a mangrove forest area of 231 square kilometer with a major chunk lying in Bhitarkanika. It stands second only to Sundarbans in West Bengal. Besides Bhitarkanika in Kendrapara, the districts of Balasore, Bhadrak, Jagatsinghpur and Puri are also home to mangrove, otherwise known as coastal woodland.Mangroves play a crucial role in protecting human and animal communities from massive storms.Bhitarkanika National ParkMangrove roots can break up the force of a storm surge, soaking up some of its energy and protecting people living on coasts from cyclone damage.Climate change has resulted in a spike in frequency and intensity of cyclonic storms.The aerial roots of mangrove forests retain sediments and stabilise the soil in the areas between high tide and low tide (intertidal areas) by reducing erosion during storms and floods. The roots, trunk and canopy of the mangroves can dissipate storm surges and waves.Mangroves can also cope with sea level rise through gradual vertical growth."

They couldn't sleep for two nights and couldn't figure out if they should use the ticket or give it back to the woman who owned it. After a lot of thinking and talking to other relatives, the shop owners then decided that they should give back the ticket because it is the right thing to do. Since Fiega was a regular customer at the shop, the shop owners found her work address and told her the entire thing. Obviously, Fiega was in disbelief and thanked the Shah family.HT"

Gupta had plans to send his 12-year-old daughter, Kyati, to Poland and represent the country in fencing but the pandemic put cold water on his plans.The situation is such that Khyati has been forced to remain at home, with the family even finding it tough to pay her school fees.Another case involves the 44-year-old Mahendra Pratap Singh who is an experienced archery coach.

He had also represented UP at the national level for 8 years.PTIThe 56-year-old Mohammad Naseem Quereshi is a national-level boxing coach but has now become a tea-seller. Having been forced to sell tea to make ends meet, Quereshi recently received some financial support from his students who were disappointed seeing him resort to such a job.RP Singh, UP's director of Sports, has said that contractual staff will be given preference, having seen the plight of such established coaches in the state.""Decision to hire staff on outsourcing was implemented across all government departments and the contractual coaches should apply through the designated portal for selection through outsourcing agencies. He admitted to Aaj Tak that after seeing the case studies, he will give preference to contractual staff for sure,"" he said."

541223," WhatsApp has gone ahead and filed a legal suit against the Indian government in New Delhi seeking to block the newly laid-out regulations that are coming into force today.AFPAlso Read: India Could Block Facebook, Twitter, Instagram From May 26: Here's WhyAccording to the sources, the case highlights that compliance with the new regulations would force Facebook to break privacy protections. According to a Reuters report, people familiar with the suit have asked the Delhi High Court to declare that one of the new rules is a violation of privacy rights in Indias constitution as it asks social media company to identify the first originator of the information when demanded by the authorities.Even though the law asks the app to only reveal people who shared the problematic media in the first place, WhatsApp cant just unmask this person due to the end-to-end encrypted nature of its messages. If it had to do it, it would require the breaking of encryption for receivers as well as originators of the message.WhatsApps suit also cites a 2017 case known as Puttaswany from the Supreme Court that supported privacy, to strongly make its point.Also Read: Indian Govt Sets New Rules For Online Video Services And Social MediaThe Reuters report also highlights that it couldnt independently confirm whether the complaint had been filed in the court by WhatsApp nor when it would be reviewed by the court. People involved in this matter have refrained from divulging anything due to the sensitivity of the issue.The new rules were first three months ago on February 25, where it gave companies a deadline of 90 days to comply with the newly laid-out guidelines, failing to do so would strip the social media platforms of their intermediary status and would subject them to legal, even criminal action as deemed fit under the court of law.ReutersAmong the new guidelines, one major requirement is for the social media firms to appoint Indian citizens to key compliance roles. It is also asking for the removal of objectionable content within 36 hours of legal order and set up a system to respond to complaints. They must also use automated processes to take down pornography.Facebook in a statement has said that it agrees with most new provisions however, it still wants to negotiate some aspects of it.Also Read: Twitter Tags Sambit Patras Tweet As Manipulated Media, MeitY Wants Tag RemovedTwitter on the other hand hasnt been in the governments good books after it flagged a post shared by BJP spokesperson as manipulated media resulting in Delhi Police raiding the Twitter office a few days back."

541205," If you are a millennial, you have probably binged watched FRIENDS several times. We laughed, we cried and we grew up with Ross, Monica, Rachel, Joey, Phoebe, and Chandler.The show might have been very progressive at the time when it first aired in 1994, but if you watch it today, there are some moments that will make you uncomfortable. There's sexism, homophobia, body-shaming and more.Here are some of the moments from FRIENDS that we didn't realize were problematic, or perhaps, we chose to ignore.The jokes were on Monica's body weight. From fat sister jokes to awkward dance parties, Fat Monica became a butt of jokes on the show, only because she was fat. Her own parents constantly shamed her about job, looks and weight. Perhaps, no show ever has fat-shamed a character more than Friends body-shaming teenage Monica.In this particular scene, there were a lot of offensive one-liners. Chandler and Monica were uncomfortable around transgender, gays and queers. ""Don't you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?"" that's what Nora, Chandler's mom says to Charles Bing.When Rachel hires a nanny for Ross' baby, and a male nanny turns up, Ross assumes he is gay, because nannies are always females.They didn't gross out, they grossed us out. ""Would you guys relax? This is the most beautiful and natural thing in the world,"" says Ross to which Joey responds, ""Yeah we know, but theres a baby suckin on it,"" says Joey.Breastfeeding is natural. There is nothing gross about it. Joey was just being immature.Because women couldn't have otherwise won, right? They don't know anything about sports. They will have to flash to win. This was pure sexist.Spreading lies about sexual orientation, Rachel tells everyone in her office that Tag is gay, just so women won't pursue him. Wasn't that harassment?That's sexual harassment at work, and not a joke to be laughed at, right?In one of the Thanksgiving episodes Ross asks, ""Hey, Joey, are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?"" To this, Joey, responds, ""No, only for sex."" Furthermore, they both look for ways to trick women into sleeping with them.In one of the episodes, Rachel wants Ross to turn around as she changes her dress. She has hurt her rib before a fancy event and asks Ross to help her get ready. He refuses to turn around because, ""Rach, I can see you naked any time I want, all I have to do is close my eyes.""He ended up calling her elephant.Ross tries to have sex with his first cousin and his excuse it that he hasn't had sex in a long time. Would you ever be comfortable around such men?That isn't funny. That is creepy. Again, would you be comfortable around such men?When Joey helped Mr. Treeger learn dance, he was called ""gay"" by Monica.Also Read: Rewatch Marathon! 13 Classic Hindi Comedy Shows From The '90s That Are Way Better Than FRIENDS"

Ships were battered at sea due to strong winds and several videos and photos showing it were posted on social media platforms.A video of a tugboat being tossed about in the Arabian Sea has surfaced on the internet.The boat, Varaprada, was carrying 13 people when it sank off the coast of Maharashtra on May 17. Unfortunately, only two people survived since they jumped into the waters and were rescued by the Navy.The video was shot by an unidentified person before the Varaprada sank.WATCH: Dramatic visuals of tug boat #Varaprada stranded in the rough #ArabianSea, before it sank due to #CycloneTauktae showed the deck is littered with wooden planks and strands of rope.

541197," Update : This book has been removed from Amazon now. While the country is reeling through the devastating effects of the second wave of COVID, citizens have been questioning the government and its contribution to tackling this pandemic. While news channels and papers are continuously trying to showcase the Centre's, especially PM Modi's brilliant contribution as a leader, this country's nave citizens still don't get it. In fact, they are not even trying to see the ""bigger and positive"" picture. All they can see are the number of deaths, lack of beds and oxygen in hospitals and all those negative ""unnecessary"" stuff during this pandemic. Hah! How juvenile.Well, there's no need to worry for anyone who still needs a proper answer on PM Modi's contribution to this country. An author by the name of Berozgar Bhakt has published a book by the name of ""MASTERSTROKE: 420 secrets that helped PM in India's employment growth!"" that as the name suggests, talks about everything the PM has done so far to increase employment opportunities for India or to emerge glorious in the war against COVID-19.AmazonThe cover of the book is a large picture of the PM and has over 56 pages. So, if you can't wait and are super excited to read what all these 56 pages include, we're sorry to disappoint but all of them are empty. That's right! The book talking about PM Modi's accomplishments is completely blank. Ironic, isn't it?Hey, but one can't get mad about it, right? Maybe the author wants you to depict your own picture and write his accomplishments. Maybe he wants to know what the PM has done for you during these tough times. Or maybe it's a massive dig on him. Who knows, right?Regardless, this book obviously has gotten viral on social media and might even reach the ranks of New York Bestseller.It is available on Amazon and is also free to ""read"" on Kindle.

If approved, it would give birth to the worlds first legal framework for integrating autonomous vehicles in regular traffic, according to the German government.The bill was passed by lawmakers in a late-night session on Thursday allowing specifically fully autonomous systems under Level 4 classification which is defined as when a computer is in complete control of the vehicle and no human driver is necessary to control or monitor it.The rule, according to the Transport Ministry, has been drafted in a way to offer more flexibility, including that the new regulations wont require a human to be on standby at all times -- something that is pretty common today.Along with this, the bill has highlighted that it would allow driverless shuttle busses as well as self-driving public transport buses to be put into use by 2022.

It definitely is not a cafe but things are changing for good as one can get to enjoy a cup of coffee at the LoC in J&Ks Uri sector and experience being on ground zero.Mohd Razak Khan, 48, owner of the army-run caf along the Line of Control (LoC) at Kaman Post (also known as Aman Setu), the last post on this side of LoC in north Kashmirs Uri, has high hopes of peace and tourism now.Since the caf has been thrown open by the Army at the LoC which at a moment looks impossible, but I believe that this human friendly gesture will truly invite peace and tourism to the border town, says Khan, an ex-serviceman of Indian Army.Idrees BukhtiyarOn May 18, the local Veer Naris (Martyr widows) of Indian Army inaugurated a full-fledged cafeteria named Caf Freedom at Kaman Post with an aim to allow the people to visit the forward post to see the ground situation themselves. The Army has also installed a majestic 60 feet flag pole on which the national flag flutters magnificently and one can also take souvenirs home as the memory of their border visit.It is a proud moment for us that Veer Naris inaugurated this caf who has sacrificed everything for the country, said Major Vishal Dev of Indian Army in Uri.Khan, a native of LoC village Uroosa in Uri has himself witnessed intense shelling and cross-border firing but now wants peace. I had taken up the plan to start a caf here at LoC and the Army agreed to it. They have given me a space to earn my livelihood again, he said.Idrees BukhtiyarHe said that is expecting a huge flow of locals and visitors once the COVID lockdown is over. The entry to this area is exempted as of now due to the surge in COVID cases but this coffee shop will boost the relations between the valley people and Army, he said.Being a border town and highly fortified, the opening of the caf is seen as the major development as it is believed that the move will lead to better ties between both countries.Idrees BukhtiyarLocals in Uri told India Times that opening of caf could have been taken after the February 25 decision wherein India and Pakistan agreed to ceasefire along LoC. We welcome the opening of the cafeteria by the Army at LoC but we hope that this will bring the peace along too, says Bashir Ahmad Bhat, a local RTI activist.Mohd Shafi Wathloo, Chairman Market Association Uri says that newly established caf at LoC can play a crucial role to bring peace along the both sides. This act of the Army is a sign of positivity and has signaled that the soldiers on this side of LoC want better relations and are waiting for the response of the other side. Resumption of the cross- LoC trade will also help the cafeteria to run its business smoothly as the drivers from other side of LoC would stop at Kaman Post for the food, he said.Chairman cross-LoC Trade Salamabad-Uri Hilal Turkey said that the Armys move will definitely open the doors of cross-LoC trade. Since we are aware about the situation of the LoC and one fears going to such places, opening a caf there means a lot. It will help in building peace, generating employment and will pave way for the reopening of the trade route too, he hoped.Idrees BukhtiyarEstimating the cost incurred due to the suspension of cross-LoC trade, Turkey said, An annual loss of about INR 40 crore has been incurred by different stakeholders along the Uri-Muzaffarabad route in the last two years.Reyaz Ahmad Budoo, a resident of Garkote village of Uri whose brother is married in Muzaffrabad in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) said that resumption of cross-LoC bus service will boost tourism at Kaman. The guests from PoK will be getting a warm welcome by the Army at the cafeteria and will sit over to have some food. This facility will definitely fascinate the guests, he said.Idrees BukhtiyarAs part of the Confidence Building Measure (CBM) between India and Pakistan, cross-LoC bus service, trade was started in 2005 and 2008 respectively via Kaman Post but both are suspended till date. The bus service was suspended following the Pulwama attack on February 14, 2019 and while as trade on 18 April 2019 reportedly after the misuse of arms and drug smugglers.An Army official at Uri told India Times that they have set up this caf for the public. We want to make the spot as the major attraction for the visitors who besides overlooking the other side of LoC, taking selfies, can also relish the coffee and snacks too, he said.Idrees BukhtiyarHe said that they have been organizing the motivational tours for the schools and colleges to this forward post. We guide them on the importance of this place and give them a chance to see the other side of the border, he said.Once the COVID lockdown will be over, the spot will open for people who wish to visit here after opting for the necessary permission from the Uri Brigade, he said adding, People will get to see the ground situation themselves.Idrees BukhtiyarAbid Fareed, a 1st year student of Degree College Uri who visited the caf said, I visited the place after a gap of three years but we always had a wonderful experience of being there.

Our aim is to make diamond jewellery accessible to a wider audience. Read more on Copenhagen-based company said that the man-made diamonds have the same optical, chemical, thermal and physical characteristics as those excavated from a mine.But they can be created at about a third of the cost as compared to the mined ones and seem to be targeted towards millennials, who are increasingly concerned about the environment and human rights violations in the mining industry.ReutersDiamonds are not only forever, but for everyone, Pandora Chief Executive Alexander Lacik said in a statement as the company launched its lab-made collection, called Pandora Brilliance, in the United Kingdom.They are as much a symbol of innovation and progress as they are of enduring beauty and stand as a testament to our ongoing and ambitious sustainability agenda, he added.The new collection includes rings, bangles, necklaces and earrings and start at 250 (25,000).Getty ImagesLab-grown stones have been billed as the ethical, traceable alternative to mined diamonds. Pandora says they are graded by the same standards known as the 4Cs--cut, colour, clarity and carat--before being sold.Pandora says that the lab-created diamonds in the collection have been grown with more than 60 per cent renewable energy on average--a ratio that is expected to rise to 100 per cent when the company launched the collection globally next year.According to an Antwerp World Diamond Centre and Bain & Co. report, global diamond sales fell 15 per cent in 2020 due to the travel restrictions and lockdowns amid the pandemic. Production of rough diamonds fell 20 per cent in 2020 and prices declined by 11 per cent.Getty ImagesThe production of lab-grown diamonds reached 6-7 million carats with up to 60 per cent of it manufactured in China using high-pressure, high-temperature technology. Another technology using chemical vapor deposition is gaining share, with India and the US emerging as major production centers.So, are lab-made diamonds the solution? Well, there are two challenges. One, they can take a lot of energy to produce, but some producers like Diamond Foundry claim their process in ""100% hydro-powered, meaning zero emissions"".Getty ImagesAnother, as pointed out by the World Diamond Council (WDC) in a BBC report, is that small-scale diamond mining communities would lose their primary source of income if mining of diamonds is stopped, causing devastating impacts on their livelihoods.Whats your pick: a mined diamond or a lab-made one?

538424," Chocolates are often associated with weight gain, however, a new study shows substituting fatty snacks with a cup of cocoa (the primary component that makes chocolates) could help people suffering from obesity lose weight, even if they continue to consume a high-fat diet.Getty ImagesThis is according to a study published in the journal Nutritional Biochemistry where they found mice given a dietary supplement of cocoa powder resulted in reduced DNA damage and amount of fat in their livers.Cocoa is the primary ingredient for making chocolate, but while its assumed to be unhealthy, cocoa on its own is known to be rich in fibre, iron and phytochemicals -- chemical compounds found in plants that aid the immune system and reduce the risk of cancer, dementia, arthritis, and even cardio-metabolic diseases like stroke, heart diseases and type-2 diabetes, according to Professor Joshua Lambert, at the Pennsylvania State University.Lambert wanted to further investigate the effects of cocoa on the human body, specifically with its effects on non-alcoholic related fatty liver disease.For this study, the obese mice with liver disease were treated with a high-fat diet supplemented with 80 milligrams of cocoa powder per gram of food.Researchers overserved changes in fatty liver disease, markers of oxidative stress, antioxidant response and cell damage in these mice. Researchers discovered that the mice on cocoa supplements gained weight at a 21 percent lower rate and had smaller spleen weights compared to high-fat-fed control mice who werent offered the cocoa supplement.The smaller spleen indicated less inflammation. As the eight-week study period ended, mice that fed the cocoa had 28 percent less fat in their livers compared to the mice group that didnt get any cocoa.They also found that cocoa-consuming mice had 56 percent lower levels of oxidative stress, 75 percent lower levels of DNA damage in the liver compared to high-fat diet mice.A previous study by Professor Lamberts lab has shown some chemicals in cocoa powder inhibit enzymes that enable the digestion of dietary fat, allowing fat to just pass through the body without being absorbed.Professor Lambert doesnt recommend consuming large amounts of cocoa and not altering anything in the overall diet, instead, he asks to substitute other fatty snacks for a cup of cocoa.Getty ImagesLambert explains, This exchange is potentially beneficial, especially in combination with a healthy overall diet and increased physical activity. If you go to the gym and work out, and your reward is you go home and have a cup of cocoa, that may be something that helps get you off the couch and moving around."

The questionnaire looked at sleep quality, fatigue level, work engagement and how their workday was.The second study was somewhat similar to this. Here, 222 employees were given three surveys (morning, afternoon during lunch and evening while leaving) to answer for five consecutive days.The study saw that workers when arrived at work tired, they ended up taking more microbreaks, at regular intervals. Researchers discovered that these small breaks helped in balancing their energy levels that helped workers feel optimistic about their work.Sophia Cho, a psychology professor at North Carolina State University explains, Basically, microbreaks help you manage your energy resources over the course of the dayand that's particularly beneficial on days when you're tired.Getty ImagesResearchers also discovered that the employees were more driven to take these microbreaks if they felt that their employer was more concerned about the employees well being.Cho added, 'When people think their employer cares about their health, they feel more empowered to freely make decisions about when to take microbreaks and what type of microbreaks to take. It is in a company's best interest to give employees autonomy in terms of taking microbreaks when they are needed. It helps employees effectively manage their energy and engage in their work throughout the day."

526713," No one likes stinky feet -- neither the person who possesses it nor people who are around them. Sadly for people in certain professions -- especially one that involves wearing socks and footwear for extended periods of time -- this is unavoidable.However, it looks like a group of researchers in Thailand might have a solution that could eliminate the stink out of the feet.Getty ImagesScientists in Thailand have developed a special coating for socks that destroys the bacteria responsible for smelly feet. Researchers followed up from previous studies that had revealed that zinc oxide nanoparticles have antibacterial properties. This was revealed at the 29th European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress.Dr Punyawee Ongsri, the lead author of the study explained, While completing an internship as a naval officer in the medical department, I saw a high number of foot infections in military personnel. I wanted to find a way to prevent and treat these fungal and bacterial infections and those conditions associated.Previous studies had demonstrated zinc oxide nanoparticles's antibacterial properties therefore [we wanted] to test the efficacy of this new technology in a real-life setting.Ongsri and his team tested the antibacterial socks on 148 cadets at the Thai Naval Rating School as bromodosis and pitted keratolysis -- two of the main causes of smelly feet are commonly experienced by people in the military.The cadets were assigned to a 14-day field training course where researchers randomly assigned the zinc-nanoparticles socks to some cadets while some got regular socks. Cadets were asked to self-assess their foot odour levels and complete certain questionnaires. Dermatologists were also on the floor, performing foot examinations.Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol UniversityThe study revealed that those with zinc-nanoparticles socks had considerably lower levels of odour compared to the regular socks. They also found that ones with the zinc-nanoparticles socks had lower chances of getting keratolysis compared to conventional socks.Dr Ongsri further stated, Our results prove the efficacy of ZnO-NP-coated socks in preventing bromodosis and inhibiting the development of pitted keratolysis. These socks could provide a new primary prevention option for both military personnel and those susceptible to these embarrassing and unpleasant conditions."
522490," If anything, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a wake-up call - regarding how to live, our lifestyle and especially how we save and manage our money.With a number of people losing jobs and facing pay cuts, money management has never felt so important. Living on a budget is a way of life now even for millennials who usually live with a ""live in the moment"" attitude.Also Read: How To Manage Your Finances Better During The PandemicThis pandemic has been a teaching experience and these are the few money lessons that one should have learnt from this pandemic, you know, just for the futures sake. We need to apply these lessons because even the WHO has declared that this might not be the last pandemic.IstockHere are some of the crucial financial lessons to be learnt from this pandemic so as to avoid such mistakes in the future:One thing that the pandemic has made us all realise is that we can all save way more than we think. We were forced to stop eating out, go shopping, partying, go to movie theatres or concerts etc. While these are the things we will want to do as things slowly go back to normal, we have had a glimpse of how much we can save if we do not indulge in them as often as we used to.Also Read: A Millennials Guide To The Basics Of Stock Markets & Ways To Invest In ItRepresentational ImageI personally have realised that there is no need for going out to shop every week, one usually ends up buying and spending way more than one needs. Another thing the pandemic has forced us to do is cook at home and it's unbelievable, the amount of money we can save by not eating out.This habit of saving money by not going shopping or movies every week should linger.Also Read: 7 Tips To Keep In Mind While Buying Property Post PandemicThe coronavirus pandemic has taught us the importance of savings. Many of us have been used to a hand to mouth lifestyle and spending money on entertainment. When the pandemic began and people started to lose their jobs, they realised they hardly had any backup money to support them. That is what exactly an emergency fund is - a backup - money for emergencies like these. In uncertain times the emergency fund can be a great financial support, for example in need of a medical emergency.Rerepsentational Image/UnsplashIf unfortunately, you are someone who has been laid off from your job for some reason, you can rely on your emergency fund until you get back on track.Save enough to have at least 5-6 months of expenses in your emergency fund, for worst-case scenarios.It will be a good idea to not just put your money in a savings account but somewhere that gives you better returns like Liquid Mutual Funds.A lot of us do not get a health insurance plan as the company where we work offers it. However, during the pandemic, a lot of people lost their jobs, which means they also lost their health insurance plan. Under such circumstances, if any of your family members requires hospitalisation, it will have to go from your pocket. If you are someone who has lost their job, this would further exacerbate your financial strain.Representational Image/UnsplashThat is why you need your own health insurance policy, to keep you covered under such circumstances.So get a health insurance policy of your own even if you are covered under a corporate health policy.Different asset classes perform well at different times, therefore diversifying your investments means that the risks are covered.An investor who has diverse investments can not only survive difficult times but could actually benefit from the situation.As ET Money mentions, gold prices were stagnant for a long time before they started going up last year. At the same time equities were running up when gold wasnt and then they crashed while gold delivered amazing returns.Representational Image/UnsplashHowever, how much you want to invest in each asset should not be based on returns it is generating now but be a function of the risk you want to take. You should take guidance from an expert on the kinds of diversified investments you can/should make.While you might be a lucky person to have not lost your job during the pandemic or faced any salary cuts but not everyone has been that lucky. However to be able to ride through such times these things can act as lifesavers - knowing how to live on a budget and not having high-interest debt.High-interest debt, like credit card or personal loan, is harmful to you financially even when you have a regular paycheque in your hand. The damage caused by them increases many folds if you are out of a job. Further, if you are unable to pay on time, the piling interest rate can increase the debt amount.Representational Image/UnsplashIt would take way longer than you planned, to get out of such a debt. So it is feasible to stay away from high-interest rate debt. Even if you are using a credit card for expenditures, spend only as much as you can pay by the next month.This should be a habit. Having a loose hand with money does not benefit anyone even with a regular income. Living hand to mouth does not prepare you for future emergencies,Living on a budget, like many of us have had to do during the pandemic, makes you realise the difference between necessities and wants. It helps demarcate what your needs are and exactly how much money can you pull through if needed.Representational Image/UnsplashJob losses and severe pay cuts forced many of us to live on a budget. The idea is to foster that habit. Living on a budget is what will help you to save and keep money aside for emergency funds.These are not complicated points, most of us have been taught these lessons by the pandemic and the wise thing to do would be to learn from them."

510350," Saving money can be a challenging task for most of us, especially when some of us don't even earn enough to pay our bills, let alone have anything left to save. However, we do end up making some ill-considered decisions while we are broke, which lead to a longer period of living with little or no money. Managing expenses can be hard, but if we avoid doing certain things, we can actually manage to save a decent amount which might come in handy when we need it.Here are some things you might want to steer clear of if you're broke and trying to save money:1. Take a loan: If you don't have enough money to pay your bills, you definitely do not have enough money to pay another monthly payment. Taking out a loan while being broke might be a bad decision and you should steer clear of it unless absolutely necessary.Also Read: Planning To Buy A Car?

Give out a loan to someone else: If you don't have money for yourself, then that also means you have no money for anybody else. Do not fall prey to anyone asking you for a loan while you are broke because you never know when they will pay you back or how urgently you will need the cash.PixabayAlso Read: Here Are The Six Money Lessons That The Covid Pandemic Taught Us5.

Lose your job or quit it without having a backup: All of us have felt like quitting our jobs at least once but if you are going broke, quitting your job is actually a very bad decision and can place you in a very poor situation, quite literally.

510075," *I dont understand stock markets*This is a very common reply of many who have no clue about stocks or even those who might have a little knowledge of stock markets. And lets be honest, for many, just the look of the numbers, charts and fluctuating figures is enough to scare them away from trying to even remotely gain an understanding of what it actually is.ReutersFor those who have gathered the courage to understand the workings of the stock market heres an ""explain like Im five"" guide to something that scares the bejesus out of several mortals.One of the most basic things you must remember about the stock market is that there are companies that issue shares of stock to help provide financing for their existence and growth. When you own shares of stock, you own some per cent of the company. And as for shares value, just the way youd shop at a vegetable market where the prices of onions, tomatoes vary by the day, the same happens with stocks or equities, its value fluctuates on a daily basis.To begin with, the share market is a source for companies to raise funds and for investors to buy part-ownership in growing businesses and grow their wealth. But how does that help you?Lets say that in the future you have plans to buy a house or a car and you are looking to grow your wealth. The best way to start saving for it is to invest your money in the right places. Investing in share markets help you gain high returns.While investing in a stock market, one can make money through dividends earned on stocks, mutual funds, real estate investment trusts and other income investments. While doing so, one has the benefit of earning capital gains when stocks they bought are sold at a profit. But theres a downside, if youve invested in a company thats losing money, you can run the risk of stock values decreasing.ReuetrsA stock exchange facilitates stock brokers to trade company stocks and other securities. A stock may be bought or sold only if it is listed on an exchange. Thus, it is the meeting place of the stock buyers and sellers. India's premier stock exchanges are the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange.There are two main types of stocks that investors can own: common stock and preferred stock. When you buy a share, you can be a common shareholder or preferred shareholder on the basis of ownership. Both of these stocks represent ownership in a company but unlike the common stocks, the preferred shares normally come with a fixed dividend. As a preferred shareholder, you may not have voting rights. But you will get dividends before the common shareholder receives them. There is also something called 'convertible preferred stock'. This is basically a preferred stock with an option of converting into a fixed number of common shares.Many people shrug away and think that investing in the stock market needs a lot of money to start. But in reality, you can start your investment with as little as Rs. 500/. The easiest way to get started is to open a trading account with an online brokerage. From there, you can begin investing by purchasing shares of stocks, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investments. When purchasing individual stocks, investing in mutual funds, bonds or other investments, look at the current price, earnings per share, short- and long-term trading ranges, yield, and any rating cautions. Its always better to do your own research before investing and always be updated with share market news.You can buy any number of shares you want, but most people buy in multiples of 100 shares. Traders and investors continue to buy and sell the stock of the company on the exchange, although the company itself no longer receives any money from this type of trading. You can buy stocks from any online discount broker, from a bank with a brokerage division, or from any other legitimate brick & mortar or online brokerage firm.You are bound to be emotional and overwhelmed when you first start investing in the stock market as earning good returns may make you happy but losing money can be painful. If the risk of a drop in prices makes you anxious all the time, then stock market investing is not going to be your cup of tea. According to Warren Buffett, the stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient. The general direction that the stock market takes can affect the value of a stock are:A. Bull marketStock prices are rising and investor confidence is growing. Its often tied to economic recovery or an economic boom, as well as investor optimism.B. Bear marketA beak market where stock prices are falling and investor confidence is fading. It often happens when an economy is in recession and unemployment is high, with rising prices.Any stock is still only as good as the company that issues the stock. It is always prone to outside forces like competition, industry shifts, regulations and natural disasters, just like the current coronavirus crisis. So, dont get your hopes too high while investing in stocks, brace yourself for both the good and the bad.It takes years to become well versed in reading financial markets and managing stocks in general. You may want to find someone you trust and seek their guidance."
509179," Millennials do not have any concept of savings. We believe in spending as much as we earn, living hand to mouth does not really scare us, it is our lifestyle. The existential lifestyle that a lot of us believe in makes us not care for the uncertainties of life. We believe in living in the moment and so we do not even bother to think of the future.We see any kind of investment as a waste of money, and insurance feels no different.The truth, it is novice of us to think this way. In fact, having insurance of our valuable possessions can save us from the burnt that results from an unexpected loss, the value of which we understand only after we lose it.IndiatimesSo, before it gets too late, let's know a bit about various types of insurance and its requirement.Here we explore the topic of insurance, what it is, the most common types of it, why millennials do not believe in it and why they should.According to Investopedia, Insurance is a contract, represented by a policy, in which an individual or entity receives financial protection or reimbursement against losses from an insurance company. Insurance policies are used to hedge against the risk of financial losses, both big and small, that may result from damage to the insured or their property, or from liability for damage or injury caused to a third party.'To get insured is important but it is also important to know how it works.An insurance policy's premium is its price, typically expressed as a monthly cost. The premium is determined by the insurer based on your or your business's risk profile, which may include creditworthiness.Insure Invest FinancialDifferent insurers can charge different premiums for similar policies. So finding the price that is right for you requires some work on your part.The policy limit is the maximum amount an insurer will pay under a policy for a covered loss. Maximums may be set per period (e.g., annual or policy term), per loss or injury, or over the life of the policy, also known as the lifetime maximum.Mostly the higher limits carry higher premiums.This is the amount the policy-holder must pay out-of-pocket before the insurer pays a claim.'ShutterstockDeductibles serve as deterrents to large volumes of small and insignificant claims.'One misconception is that it is expensive. This is because most of us do not have an understanding of available policies in the market.We are risk-averse: This also means that we are hesitant about investing in an instrument where there is no immediate return. The lack of long term planning is, therefore, one of the biggest deterrents for millennials on the road to insurance.Below mentioned are the major types of insurance that millennials need to be aware of, needless to mention there are many more.As the name suggests the subject matter of this insurance is the life of a human being. The insurer is supposed to pay the fixed amount of insurance at the time of death or at the expiry of a certain period.Life insurance enjoys the maximum scope because well, life is the most valued human property and therefore everyone needs this.ForbesThis insurance gives protection to the family at the premature death of the insurer or gives an adequate amount at old age.This is important for anyone as it covers people for their medical care; for serious illnesses like heart attacks too.Under this property of person/persons are insured against a certain specified risk. The risk can be fire or marine perils, theft of property or goods damage to property at the accident.Fire Insurance as the name suggests, covers the risk of fire. With the help of fire insurance, the losses arising due to fire are compensated.With this insurance, the persons property or business will remain approximately in the same position in which it was before the loss.Financial ExpressFire insurance can protect against consequential losses like war risk, turmoil, riots, etc.According to idunote, the guarantee insurance covers the loss arising due to dishonesty, disappearance, and disloyalty of the employees or second party. The party must be a party to the contract. His failure causes loss to the first party.The property, goods, machine, furniture, automobiles, valuable articles, etc. can be insured against the damage or destruction due to accident or disappearance due to theft.These are a few insurance types millennials need to be aware of."

373991," We all know that China has set up a different internet of its own where it closely monitors its citizens for the kind of content being circulated with people. The country is somewhat disconnected with the world and lives in its own internet bubble. This also means that they don't have access to the apps, services and websites like we do.But that doesn't mean they're limited by any means.

How cool is that?Yes, the don't even get Facebook and Twitter! However, they have Weibo, which has become the most popular social media platform in China with over 462 million users.

356957," Electric vehicles have started occupying the roads across the globe and looking at the inclination of the industry, consumers and the world governments, they are pretty much here to stay. Not just that, as the paradigm transition takes place in the automobile sector, they are only going to expand in numbers and one look at the set targets by the auto manufacturers will easily tell you that this growth is going to happen exponentially.It is good, isnt it? For the consumers, countries as well as the environment. But as they say, too much of anything is bad. So while electric vehicles themselves might not be bad per se, the corresponding increase in the demand for lithium-ion batteries powering them is poised to be a real issue. A fraction of this problem is how the batteries will be discarded after they are inefficient for these vehicles.ReutersAfter all, they are batteries. Meaning a chemical composition which is bound to degrade any natural medium in which they are discarded. To prevent this, the said battery waste has to be cut down before it grows so large in number that it starts becoming a problem. And one golden rule of cutting down on waste is Re-use.That brings us to the first solution of the problem. EV batteries are deemed unfit for the vehicles when their efficiency drops down to 70 percent of their original prowess. As per the claims by most of the auto makers, this tenure lasts almost a decade. This means that while the batteries will not be able to run a vehicle with the same competence, they are still very much operational.So an obvious way of reusing would be to put them to other uses until they die down to zero. Most of the battery makers are already following this and have found several ways to put such batteries to use. A common method, is to appoint them with solar panels or practically any other renewable source of energy which needs storage. This, can be further used to power homes, office setups or any or every facility that draws power from the grid.Though this might not be enough to eliminate the dependency on the power grid, it still can act as a huge deterrent from it. As of today, such an arrangement of used EV batteries as well as new ones are being used to power the Johan Cruyff Arena in Amsterdam. A collaboration between Nissan, Eaton, BAM, The Mobility House and the Johan Cruijff ArenA, the one-of-its-kind setup claims enough power to back up the 7000 Amsterdam houses for one hour, or charge 5,00,000 iPhones. The green impact can be measured from the fact that it claims to save 116,683 tons of CO2.ReutersSo if such a wide-scale model is successful, a miniaturised version for supplying green energy to homes isnt out of bounds at all. That is exactly why the idea is being accommodated by companies like Nissan. Though it is not too widespread for one practical purpose, which coincidentally also brings us to our next solution.The problem with using old EV batteries for energy storage for homes is the fact that these batteries are too high-class for such a use. The effort and money that goes into making such batteries is way too much for a stationary use as in the case of homes. Citing this reason, Mercedes-Benz exited the home energy business just after a year of its operation. That, however, might not be the best reasoning for restricting the reuse of a hoard of batteries which are already going to waste.As with any other waste, recycling is one way to go. There are firms operating to do this, taking out precious metals from the EV batteries for recycling. There are hindrances and the process is not a piece of cake, but it works for them, meaning it should work for the others too.ReutersThat is also why all the major battery producers, including Tesla, are looking for ways to recycle their batteries as well, essentially creating a loop of battery production. It might take time for the companies to set the process in place, but this is a definite in the pipeline for almost every major battery player.Again, like any other resource, humanity demands alternatives, and that is true even in the case of EV batteries. Now you might be wondering that the EV batteries have only started to emerge on the main scale. But consider the fact that lithium-ion batteries have been powering almost every gadget known to humankind today. Using the same for electric vehicles only adds on to the pressure on the required resources, which are of course, limited.One such resource is Cobalt, which for now, is primarily found in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Though it might be enough for now, an escalating future towards its use will land it in the same situation as the fossil fuels, slowly but surely.To avoid this, there are researches taking place to use alternate chemical combinations for batteries. A prime focus among these are the solid state batteries, which use a solid electrolyte instead of a liquid one. While these are still under a development phase for EVs, they are anticipated to provide an even better efficiency than the other battery types.ReutersBMW, Toyota and Dyson are among the ones which look at solid state batteries as a potential alternative for their products in the near future.Irrespective of which of the alternatives is appointed in doing away with lithium-ion batteries post their maximum efficiency, neither the limited availability of the metals nor the impact on environment allow us to discard them as a waste. So going forward, all the major battery players should designate one or the other process for the battery waste."
353607," One of the Four Noble Truths of the centuries-old Buddhist philosophy is to end the pain and suffering in our life.It may not be easy for everyone, but Phurba Thinley does this in a remarkable way. He found a way to fight pain when he was a young boy preparing to become a monk in a Buddhist monastery in Bhutan.For him, cessation of pain comes through the process of making people smile, and at times, laugh out loud.googleOver the years Buddhist monks, in different sects, have been following the teachings of learned elders to free themselves from all worldly pains. They tell others as well how to remain content by ignoring the temptations in this consumerist world.This kind of wisdom can surely be associated with someone who has spent quality time learning the way from revered masters. Thinley did it for years, but then he became what life chose for him instead. A monk who is now a comedian.From the most disciplined institutions of the planet which seeks renunciation and an ascetic life to being in the spotlight where he is cheered by people from all age groups, his current fame as a comedian couldn't be more contrasting with his training as a monk early on.googleBut Thinley is a star, he is cheerfulness personified. He is perhaps one of the most recognisable Bhutanese celebrities. He travels with a simple message of spreading happiness.I have travelled to many European countries and the Middle East (he names several). People recognise me, they follow my work. Its all because of the Royal Family, they gave me a chance to represent my country and I tried to do my best wherever I have gone. Its quite wonderful to receive the love that I get, not everyone is so lucky, says Thinley.After performing at the recently held Mountain Echos Festival in Thimphu, the Bhutanese superstar spoke to Indiatimes about his life journey in the serene mountains of the picturesque country. When asked about his passion for comedy and when he realized to pursue it, he replied, As a kid, I used to make fun of things around me, even at the monastery. I was talkative, and my teachers always asked me to remain quiet. Learning theology was important for me, but I just couldnt do it seriously.It took Thnley some years to decide what he actually wanted to do. But after spending initial years in the monastery and travelling as a monk, even to India, Thinley finally joined Bhutans prestigious Royal Academy of Performing Arts (RAPA) in 1996 at the age of 30.It took me time to decide what I wanted to do. I even tried to stop joking and lead a serious life like other monks, but I could not do it. Comedy comes naturally to me, he says.Thinley remembers his teachers, who did not discourage him but was not happy with his decision to leave the monastery. They thought I could at least become a teacher, if not a successful monk. They didnt want me to be a performer like this. But I just couldnt fulfil their wish, he recalls.youtubeI began by making small announcements at assemblies, during which I used to crack jokes. People somehow started liking it and it gave me a lot of confidence and then I went further ahead with my passion. Today whatever I am is because of the hard work over the years, he adds.When Thinley began his formal training and performances in the 1990s, Kader Khan, Govinda and Johnny Lever were ruling the comic scenes in Hindi films. And the three became a sort of holy trinity for Thinley as he got inspired by their performances. I just cant say enough about how these three have inspired me. I have never met them, but have definitely learnt a lot from them. I wish to meet them in Mumbai one day, he hopes.Being a performer, Thinley understands the responsibility of extending the legacy that he has built over the years. He is working hard to document and teach the skills to young performers who want to take comedy seriously.Me and my brother are writing books on the subject. We want more young people to come forward and spread the joy. Bhutan is a country of happiness. There cant be anything better than spreading it further, he says.There is a saying in Bhutanese, making people happy is the most profitable job. I am just doing that."
347131," What limits would you cross to watch your favourite cricketer in action? Bunk work, skip classes or maybe ditch your lover for the day maybe? In that case would you go to jail? Well Mahatma Gandhi's son Devdas did just that so he could watch Don Bradman bat.But there is a story to it.Wikimedia CommonsDevdas was a big fan of the Don and when the legend said that the 1948 would be his last tour to England, he knew he had just one chance to watch him in action. He happened to be in London at that time for a meeting. The first Test was in Nottingham and Devdas headed there to watch the game. But unfortunately tickets were sold out. While he was able to get a pass, the issue was where to stay because all the hotels were full.In sheer desperation the son of our Father of the Nation was able to convince the warden at the Nottingham County Jail on June 10. One wonders how he achieved it? He had been arrested during the Salt March, but this time he was back on his own accord.After having breakfast with the convicts the next day he headed for the ground to catch a glimpse of the man who had made life hell for English bowlers for 20 years.He would not be disappointed. Bradman launched himself into England's bowling and was 130 not out at the close of play. He was almost 40, but just as dangerous. Devdas got his fill and left for London after the day's play. He had watched what he came to see and had no more regrets.ReutersAustralia won by 8 wickets, but it is the story of how Devdas pushed the limits to ensure he was there to witness Bradman bat. So this is how he spent one night in jail to see the legend play. Seventy-three years later, this story still leaves people amazed as it becomes a part of cricketing folklore."
